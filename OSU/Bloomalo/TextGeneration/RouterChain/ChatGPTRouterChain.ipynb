            "\n",
            "2. Minimize distractions: Create a quiet and calm environment for reading. Ensure that Sarah is not sitting near windows or other potential distractions. Consider using noise-cancelling headphones if necessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Break down tasks into simple sequential steps: Help Sarah understand the expectations during reading time by breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps. For example, you can ask her to read a paragraph and then summarize it.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Use visual cues: Consider using timers or clocks to visually indicate the duration of reading time. This can help Sarah stay focused and aware of the time.\n",

            "5. Allow movement: Some children with ADHD benefit from movement while engaging in tasks. Allow Sarah to stand or fidget with a stress ball or other sensory tool during reading time, as long as it doesn't disrupt others.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Take regular breaks: Incorporate short breaks every 15 minutes to allow Sarah to recharge and refocus. Encourage her to engage in a quick physical activity or stretch during these breaks.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Use a daily planner: Help Sarah stay organized by using a daily planner or visual schedule. This can help her keep track of her reading assignments and other tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Reinforce good behavior: Provide positive reinforcement for Sarah's efforts and improvements during reading time. This can be in the form of treats, tokens, or tickets that she can collect and exchange for rewards.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. Establish good eye contact: Before giving directions or discussing the story, make sure Sarah is focused and paying attention. Call her name and establish eye contact to ensure she is actively listening.\n",
            "\n",
            "10. Focus on strengths: Encourage and highlight Sarah's strengths during reading time. If she struggles with comprehension, focus on her decoding skills or her ability to sound out words. Celebrate her progress and efforts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, every child is unique, and it may take some trial and error to find the strategies that work best for Sarah. It can also be helpful to involve her teacher and discuss any concerns or additional support that may be available at school.\n"
