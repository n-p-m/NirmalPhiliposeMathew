Key Tips for Blending Families After a Divorce  Coronavirus Disease 2019  Narcissism  Dementia  Bias  Affective Forecasting  Neuroscience ', ' Verified by Psychology Today ', \" Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff  Human development is influenced by, but not entirely determined by, our parents and our genes. Children may have very different personalities, and different strengths and weaknesses, than the generation that preceded them. Caregivers should pay attention to their children's distinct traits and the pace of their development, and not assume that the approach to parenting that worked for their mothers and fathers will be equally successful in their own families. Parents, and the home environments they create, can also have an important influence on a child's development; in fact, a child's home environment can affect the ways that certain genetic traits express themselves, or if they will at all. Caregivers who have a consistent approach, who are warm, and who can give children a sense of security, generally have the most positive influence on a child's development; meeting a child's physical and dietary needs are also essential as research finds that childhood neglect can disrupt development, perhaps even more than abuse does. But parents are far from the only influencers in a child's life: Siblings, grandparents, neighbors, peers, celebrities, and policymakers all may contribute to who a young person becomes as well.  Healthy development can be upended by abuse and neglect, which may disrupt cognitive and language development and socialization and particularly hamper a child's ability to develop trust or self-esteem, or to form healthy relationships with others. The effects of abuse or neglect often linger for years, but they alone do not determine a child's future. Many children raised in difficult environments develop resilience and grow to thrive as adults.  For more, see Adverse Experiences. \", ' The speedy physical and psychological changes that children undergo from birth through adolescence can leave parents and caregivers wondering how best to support them. The process of child development includes everything from sensory awareness and fine motor skills to language acquisition and socialization. Parents and medical professionals typically rely on developmental milestones, such as when a child learns to speak or read, to track their growth relative to their peers. These milestones are important markers but parents must keep in mind that every child develops at their own pace, and while one may take their first steps earlier than most, or say their first words later than most, neither is likely to affect their ultimate capabilities. However, when the benchmarks suggest that a child may be significantly delayed, it is important to consult a doctor who can identify developmental disorders and begin treatment as early as possible. For more, see Developmental Disorders and Delays.  It is widely believed that a child\\'s personality and intelligence are \"locked in\" by age 3, but there is no deadline for human social or cognitive development and the brain develops throughout one\\'s life. But decades of research in developmental psychology, pediatrics, and neuroscience have converged on the conclusion that the first five years are especially critical. During these years, children begin to explore their environment, learn verbal and reasoning skills, socialize with others, and, eventually, take steps toward asserting independence from their family. Other research has led to expert guidance on how parents and caregivers can manage a child\\'s expectations, and their own, and nurture their best qualities. For more, see Cognitive Development and Social Skills.  Children have varying physical and emotional needs, depending on their age, personality, and developmental stage. Over the past several decades, the age of puberty has been dropping for many young people, bringing an increasingly early end to childhood. Both genetic and environmental factors influence the onset of puberty, and observers believe that its early onset may to some degree reflect the stresses a child has experienced.

The Myth of 10,000 Steps  How Recent Demographic Forces Created the Solo Generation  Coronavirus Disease 2019  Narcissism  Dementia  Bias  Affective Forecasting  Neuroscience ', ' Verified by Psychology Today ', ' Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff  Children with ADHD are often bright, spontaneous, and caring. But parenting them is not without its challenges. Behavioral problems—from forgetting to do chores to outright defiance—can be frustrating for parents to navigate, as can low self-esteem, difficulty making friends, and the emotional ups and downs that are characteristic of ADHD.  In order to help their children navigate a world that isn’t always friendly to those with developmental delays or mental health challenges, parents should advocate strongly for their children’s needs—particularly in the classroom—encourage them to pursue their passions, and make sure their child feels loved, supported, and secure. Talking openly about ADHD, and seeking treatment if necessary, can also give the child the tools he needs to become his own self-advocate as he grows up. ', ' Why is my child with ADHD so defiant?  What is the most effective discipline for a child with ADHD?  Will rewards help change my child’s behavior?  How can I help my child make friends?  My child only has younger friends. Why?  Is my child addicted to video games?  How can I set limits on my child’s video game play?  Why does my child say he feels worthless?  What can I do to help build my child’s self-esteem?  What sports are best for children with ADHD?  How can I help my child with ADHD go to sleep? ', ' Defiant behavior is often linked to ADHD, particularly in children whose symptoms are primarily hyperactive. Impulsivity may result in reckless or seemingly aggressive behaviors, while emotional dysregulation and an inability to rein in anger may be another root cause of defiance. In some cases, children with ADHD also qualify for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, or ODD, a condition characterized by a persistent pattern of negative, antagonistic behavior. Harsh discipline rarely works for these children; instead, practicing compassion and focusing on skill-building are the strategies most often recommended by experts. ', ' Children with ADHD, like others, benefit from fair and consistent discipline. Experts recommend an approach that focuses on setting clear expectations, employing natural consequences—and making sure consequences are enforced consistently—and praising positive behaviors. It’s also best to avoid punishing children for behaviors that are out of their control and to discuss problematic behaviors with children to better understand their motivation. Behavior that seems to be defiant, for instance, may actually stem from frustration or anxiety; addressing the feelings that are behind the behavior will likely help mitigate outbursts in the future. ', ' There are pros and cons to using formal reward systems—such as sticker charts—to motivate a child to behave. On the one hand, many parents have found that sticker charts or other reward systems do help their child reduce problematic behaviors; this is especially likely when the goals of the sticker chart are achievable, specific, and measured over the short term. On the other hand, some parents worry that using rewards to encourage good behavior is akin to bribery—and some have found that it cultivates a negative, “what’s in it for me” attitude among children. Whether to use a sticker chart or other formal reward system is a personal decision; other, less structured rewards—such as a surprise outing after a week of good behavior or a few words of genuine praise—may be enough to motivate children without diminishing their intrinsic motivation to behave appropriately. ', ' Unfortunately, some children with ADHD may struggle to make and keep friends—often due to aggressive or hyperactive behavior, emotional outbursts, or the seeming inability to stay focused on a game or conversation. To help a child develop social skills, parents should gently but explicitly explain appropriate behavior—perhaps role-playing situations where the child often slips up, such as when she’s losing at a game—offer praise when the child succeeds, and focus on individual friendships rather than trying to force a child to fit in to a larger group. Keeping playdates short, before frustration or hyperactivity set in, can also help children end social interactions on a positive note and build up their social reputation. ', ' It’s common—and totally OK—for a child with ADHD to primarily form friendships with younger children. Since ADHD is a developmental delay, they may find that younger friends are closer to their own maturity level. Additionally, younger friends may allow a child with ADHD to feel like the leader, which they may not experience in other domains—particularly if they struggle socially with same-age peers. ', ' While experts continue to debate whether excessive video game use can truly be considered an “addiction,” it’s undeniable that many children with ADHD exhibit problematic behavior when it comes to video games. Video games are designed to be engaging and provide immediate rewards; children with ADHD may hyperfocus on them—even to the point where they become seemingly oblivious to the world around them—and may be more prone to become irritable or angry when told to stop playing. Some children may also prefer video games to other activities, like sports or schoolwork, particularly if those are areas in which they struggle. If your child plays video games for hours each day, has little interest in other activities, or becomes enraged or inconsolable when limits are set, it’s likely that she has developed a problematic relationship with gaming that should be addressed. ', ' Rather than setting overly harsh rules on video game playing or taking away the games altogether—both of which can lead to conflict and resentment—parents may be better served by a more balanced approach. Allowing a certain amount of playing, while also making sure that their child is engaging in other activities like exercise, creative play, or reading, will minimize tension and allow children to reap some of the potential benefits of video gaming. If rules are set around gameplay, be consistent about enforcing them. ', ' Trouble making friends, struggles at school, or constantly being scolded for “bad” behavior can wreak havoc on the self-esteem of a child with ADHD. It can be devastating for parents to hear their child say negative things about themselves or come to believe that they are incapable of success. While low self-esteem is a common—and reversible—side effect of ADHD, it’s critical for parents to be on the lookout for signs of depression as well, as persistent low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness may be signs of a problem that extends beyond ADHD and may require additional intervention. ', ' Parents can help cultivate self-esteem by offering real, genuine praise when a child succeeds; it’s also beneficial to encourage her to pursue her interests in order to find domains in which she excels. A child who likes to doodle, for instance, may become a talented artist, while a child drawn to cooking may feel his confidence grow as he learns to master more complicated recipes. Gradually increasing her autonomy, and making sure that she learns critical skills as she grows, can also help increase her sense of competence and self-assuredness. Making sure your child has strong relationships—whether with family members, same-age peers, or trusted adults—can go a long way toward building lasting self-esteem. ', ' Children with ADHD can excel at any sport (or other activity), particularly if they’re highly interested in it and intrinsically motivated to participate. For children who are unsure what sport they’d like to try, however, or who have struggled with activities in the past, parents may find that individual sports—like swimming, tennis, or martial arts—are ideal for allowing children to get the benefits of exercise while mitigating the social challenges that come with team sports. ', ' Some research suggests that as many as 70 percent of children with ADHD have clinical sleep disturbances—including difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night, or waking up too early in the morning. Children may also resist going to bed in the first place, becoming defiant or upset at bedtime. To counteract sleep problems, parents should establish a consistent bedtime routine and create a soothing sleep environment with minimal distractions. They should make sure their child gets regular exercise and eats a healthy diet, both of which can greatly improve sleep. If sleep problems are severe, parents may wish to try melatonin supplements. Keep in mind that stimulant medications may disrupt sleep, especially if a dose is taken later in the day; if you suspect this may be the culprit for your child’s poor sleep, talk to your doctor about reducing the dose or changing the dosing schedule.

The Myth of 10,000 Steps  How Recent Demographic Forces Created the Solo Generation  Coronavirus Disease 2019  Narcissism  Dementia  Bias  Affective Forecasting  Neuroscience ', ' Verified by Psychology Today ', ' Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff  Every adopted child is unique and has the potential to flourish in a loving home. However, because of the nature of adoption, there are several potential challenges that many adoptive parents will need to be prepared to confront. These include the aftereffects of trauma or neglect, feelings of abandonment, questions of identity, and social and emotional challenges related to race.  On the other hand, it’s important for parents to remember that not every problem, whether physical or mental, can be directly traced to a child’s adoption. Focusing on the whole of the child’s life and needs, rather than assuming adoption is behind every negative behavior, is the best way to address challenges and promote overall well-being. ', ' Common Adoption Challenges  Bridging Differences Between Parent and Child ', ' Some children who have been adopted, though not all, may experience psychological, neurological, social, medical, or behavioral problems unique to their individual situation. These potential problems, which can develop at any age, include bonding, attachment, relationship issues, cognitive delays, ADHD, defiance, and matters related to identity formation.  These problems may be due to separation from birth parents, trauma, stigmatization, cultural changes, environmental issues such as malnutrition or lead poisoning, or biological family history, including alcoholism or drug abuse. Since it is not always possible to obtain records of an adopted child’s medical history, there may be unforeseen physical health matters to address. ', ' Adoption will not necessarily have negative effects on every\\xa0adopted child. Some children, however, may experience negative emotional or psychological symptoms as a result of their adoption.  For starters, adopted children may struggle with feeling rejected by their birth family and/or like they don’t fit into their adoptive family; such feelings can be painful for children and parents alike, and may trigger negative behaviors as the child attempts to reconcile these emotions.  Adoptees, particularly those adopted at an older age, may have endured trauma, abuse, or neglect. Such children may be distrusting of adults and may struggle to bond with their adoptive family as a result. They may also present with emotional or behavioral challenges as they attempt to cope with their difficult past. Seeking help for traumatized children—and trying to see frustrating behaviors through a lens of trauma, rather than one of deliberate disobedience—can help parents put their child on a path to improved psychological health. ', ' Evidence shows that the majority of adoptees are in the normal range of behavioral and emotional adjustment. However, evidence does suggest that adoptees may be more likely than non-adopted children to be diagnosed with mental health disorders, including depression, ADHD, and addiction.  Though the exact causes for this disparity continue to be investigated—and likely differ from adoptee to adoptee—it’s likely that a combination of genetic vulnerability, past trauma, feelings of rejection, and identity crises may be responsible for the increased risk of mental health disorders seen among adopted children. ', ' It’s not always possible to pinpoint the exact cause of problematic behaviors in children, adopted or not. Some adoptees may have experienced neglect or abuse early in life, which can result in later behavioral issues. Other adoptees may feel confused about their identity and act out as a result. Some mental health disorders that can be related to behavior challenges—such as ADHD or autism—have a genetic element, and it is possible that a child is genetically predisposed to these disorders.  It’s also critical to note, however, that many non-adopted children misbehave, too; thus, a child’s challenging behaviors may be wholly unrelated to adoption. ', ' Older children often lived in foster care or an orphanage (if adopted internationally) before being adopted. There is a strong possibility in these settings for a child to have experienced trauma or neglect; as a result, they may be deeply distrusting of adults, may struggle to attach to their new family, or may behave in ways that can be confusing, upsetting, or even frightening. Children may have also experienced trauma in their family of origin before being placed for adoption.  Older children may have lived in multiple prior homes, which may have given them a heightened fear of abandonment. This may manifest as disinterest or distrust in their new family. On the flip side, some children who fear abandonment may be too trusting of any adult, never having bonded closely with any specific one. This tendency can result in unsafe behaviors if left unaddressed.  Though it is of course possible for an adopted newborn to have special needs, the nature of the adoption process means that older children are more likely to have physical or mental disabilities—or behavioral challenges such as conduct disorder—that require significant care. Though most reputable agencies will let prospective parents know in advance whether their child has special needs—and allow parents to decide beforehand whether they are prepared to care for any particular child—some challenges may not become apparent until the child is in his or her new home.  Parents should make an effort to learn as much as possible about their child’s history before the adoption, in order to better prepare themselves for their child’s specific needs. In cases where this is not possible, educating themselves about trauma, childhood mental health, and the possible effects of foster or institutionalized care can help parents get a better sense of what to expect. ', ' Adoptees—particularly those adopted at an older age—may be slow to bond with their family for a number of reasons. Children who have experienced trauma or abandonment may see their adoptive parents as untrustworthy or may assume that they too will leave the child behind; unfortunately, many foster children or those adopted internationally were previously placed in homes that they thought would be permanent but turned out not to be.  Many, if not most, adoptees eventually bond with their families. However, the process takes time (and in some cases, professional help) and requires the careful building of trust. Self-education about bonding and attachment can help parents feel more secure, be patient with themselves and their child, and learn to trust the process. However, if bonding happens slowly, it can be extremely emotionally taxing for parents and children alike. Parents should make sure they have their own support system of friends, family, and community members lined up, while also making sure they get their child the help and social support she needs to thrive. ', ' The term “post-adoption depression” refers to the onset of depressive symptoms in adoptive parents shortly after adopting a child. Though it is much less well-known, it is conceptually similar to postpartum depression and has many of the same psychological symptoms. Parents may question their own legitimacy as a parent, for instance, or worry that they will not bond with their child; these feelings can contribute to symptoms like sadness, lethargy, sleeplessness, anxiety, or guilt.  Post-adoption depression can affect mothers, fathers, and single parents—and while it is possible for it to resolve on its own, it can also be quite serious and long-lasting. Any adoptive parent who experiences depressive symptoms for longer than two weeks should not hesitate to seek professional help. ', ' Adopted children may be of a different race, ethnicity, or cultural background than their adoptive families. While many families consider these differences something to be celebrated, they can also create barriers between parent and child that will require dedicated effort (particularly on the part of the parents) to overcome.  In the U.S., most adoptive parents are white; many adopted children are not. When parent(s) and child are of different races—a situation known as transracial adoption—it’s imperative that the situation be discussed openly and honestly. Attempting to gloss over differences, or act as if they don’t exist, will likely only result in distance between family members. ', ' Since race can be a visible indicator that a child was adopted, transracial adoptees may feel acutely as if they don’t “fit in” with their family, which can aggravate the questions of identity that affect many adoptees. Strangers (or even loved ones) may further exacerbate this feeling by making rude or incorrect comments about the family or about adoption.  Adoptees of color may also experience racism or microaggressions in their adoptive community, particularly if few other people of their race or ethnicity live there. Living in a predominantly white community may also make them more likely to feel disconnected from their racial or ethnic group; some may question whether they can rightfully self-identify with their race or ethnicity if they have white parents.  A major challenge of transracial adoption is related to adoptive parents’ frequent discomfort with talking about race. If a child learns that race is an “impolite” subject to bring up, he may feel pressured to keep his race-related questions and problems to himself. Feeling unable to talk to their adoptive parents about race can create further identity challenges and may make adoptees feel isolated in their own homes. ', ' Absolutely. Adoptive parents—particularly white ones—may struggle to navigate conversations about their child’s race or openly discuss how race is viewed by society at large. But avoiding the subject altogether, or acting as if conversations about race are somehow improper, can have serious negative effects on children.  Many adult transracial adoptees report that their parents refused to talk about race at all; others adopted a “colorblind” approach and taught their children that race did not matter, despite the child’s lived experience to the contrary. Either approach can result in the child feeling shame or confusion about their racial background, or even resentment toward their adoptive parents later on. ', ' There are many\\xa0books and online resources that can help parents (adoptive or otherwise) talk to their children about race in honest, productive ways. Parents, especially if they are white, may want to acknowledge that they may make mistakes when discussing race with their child and may not always say the “right” thing. It is important to realize that such mistakes tend to be trivial in the grand scheme.  Letting a child know that it’s okay to talk about race—and taking her race-related concerns seriously when she brings them to her parents—will help her develop into a secure adult, better able to synthesize both her race and her adoptive status into her identity.

Notwithstanding your deep love for your child, parents can experience feelings of grief, anger, fear, and stress. Parents may worry that their vision for the child’s future has disappeared, that their relationship with their spouse will be strained, that the family will face mounting financial pressures. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed.  But know that autism is a common condition—around 1 of every 54 children has a diagnosis—and interventions have helped many children with autism go on to live full, meaningful lives. There are advocacy organizations, support groups, mental health professionals, and loved ones who are ready to support you and your child to the fullest. ', ' What do I do if my child is diagnosed with autism?  How do I handle the stress of raising a child with autism?  How can I help teach my child social skills?

How does having a child with autism affect their siblings?  How much does it cost to raise a child with autism?  Does insurance cover autism services? ', ' A child’s early years represent an important developmental window, so it’s valuable to research insurance coverage and explore behavioral therapies with your child’s doctor as soon as possible. These may include applied behavioral analysis, speech therapy, and occupational therapy.  Joining a local support group can be comforting and empowering, as it allows you to connect with parents going through the same experiences you are. The group can share emotions, fears, discoveries, and resources, especially those that pertain to services in their state or community.  It’s helpful to keep organized records of your child’s medical appointments to create a complete picture of your child at different stages. You may also want to take notes on developmental milestones, improvements, and health conditions.  Connect with your child in any way you can, such as by talking, reading, or showing educational videos, even if it seems like your child isn’t paying attention. Read accounts that other parents and autistic adults have written.  Finally, take care of yourself. Set aside time to recharge. Seek out positive people and avoid those who drain your energy. ', ' Many features of autism—tantrums, aggression, language deficits, limited family opportunities, and the inability to gain independence—contribute to the deep and distinct distress that many caregivers experience.  Parents can struggle with grief, sadness, anger, and hopelessness. They may fear for their safety and the safety of their children. Constantly navigating health care systems and insurance companies requires immense time, energy, and money, leading to exhaustion and financial pressures.  To navigate these challenges, parents should research and access any and all services available to them. They can lean heavily on family and friends for support. If caregivers begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, they should seek professional help. Finding a support group near you is invaluable, as its members can provide understanding, emotional strength, and crucial information. ', ' Every parent wants their children to form relationships that make them happy. Children with autism approach social situations with anxiety and frustration, but parents can help kids gain confidence, especially those on the high-functioning end of the spectrum.  Parents can model and explain social behavior to their child. After a particular interaction, they can provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation for their behavior, including their facial expression, tone of voice, and body language. Explanations and instructions that target the “why” of the behavior can be helpful since that understanding doesn’t come naturally to those with autism.  Parents can discuss social situations the child sees on TV or ones they’re likely to encounter at school. The parent and child should take turns role-playing, so that the child practices playing both individuals in the scenario.  Scheduling play dates with kids in a support group can allow children to practice social skills while providing parents an opportunity to discuss strategies with other parents. ', ' Parents should aim to be open, factual, and positive. Children pick up on others’ feelings and attitudes, which can shape how they see themselves. If parents tiptoe around autism, keep it hidden, or feel uncomfortable talking about it, children can come to believe that they should hide their autism or feel ashamed or fearful of it.  Parents can also recognize their child’s strengths and challenges. Everyone has domains in which they struggle and those in which they excel. A child with autism may struggle to connect with others but excel at sewing or math. This can be a valuable framework with which to discuss their experience. ', ' Tantrums and other difficult behaviors often emerge from an autistic child’s need to communicate. An essential component of discipline is therefore identifying what sparked their meltdown or what they want to express. Maybe the child was overwhelmed by the crowd at a holiday dinner or forbidden from playing with a toy. The first step of disciplining a child is observing and identifying potential triggers.  Parents may then seek to implement a system of rewards for positive behavior and punishment for negative behavior. Following this plan consistently can help the child understand the consequences of their actions. ', ' There is a long history of “blaming” parents for their child’s autism, most prominently when psychologist Bruno Bettelheim falsely attributed autism to a cold, detached parenting style, infamously coining the term “refrigerator mothers.” Today we know that parenting style does not lead to autism—the condition is rooted in genetics and emerges from many different factors. Parents are not at all responsible for the development of the condition.  Yet some parents, often driven by societal misperceptions, may still struggle with feelings of blame. Parents can acknowledge their emotions and fears, and then recognize that their child also has strengths that they can support and appreciate. Those on the higher end of the spectrum may also reject the premise that there is anything to be blamed for, believing that autism is not a disorder but a different way of thinking and being. ', ' Some research has identified a higher divorce rate for parents of children with autism, relative to the overall rate of divorce. A more recent study found no difference: 64 percent of children with autism had married parents, and 65 percent of children without autism had married parents. The idea that couples divorce due to autism may be overblown, or at the least, it merits more research.  Additionally, in a study of divorced parents of children with autism, 78 percent of respondents said that they divorced after their child was diagnosed, but 76 percent reported that autism wasn’t the primary reason they divorced. About half considered the diagnosis to be a contributing factor.  Strong marriages may weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side. Marriages that are already struggling may be unable to endure the additional stress, and couples may ultimately decide to divorce. Becoming aware of how the stress of a child with autism has influenced other couples may help parents of a newly diagnosed child to anticipate and overcome those challenges. ', ' A child with autism can change a family’s dynamic. Siblings of children with disabilities often grapple with stress and anxiety, in addition to emotions ranging from fear and guilt to embarrassment and resentment. They may try to hide those emotions from their parents so as not to be an additional burden.  Siblings can also experience parentification, as they may be expected to assume greater responsibilities and independence. They may feel neglected by their parents, who need to devote a tremendous amount of time to therapy and medical appointments and emotional energy into parenting. Additionally, siblings may lack the knowledge and information that parents have, which could result in fear for their sibling.  Nevertheless, siblings of children with autism can also come to embody countless positive traits, such as empathy, cooperation, tolerance, altruism, maturity, and responsibility. ', ' Raising a child with autism costs around $60,000 each year, according to the advocacy group Autism Speaks. Costs may be higher if the child’s autism is more severe.  Finances are devoted to obtaining therapies, education, caregiver time, and health care. Parents may also face financial strain because a partner may decide to leave work to care for the child full time. ', ' Services for children with autism are very often—but not universally—covered by insurance. All 50 states now require private health insurance policies to provide some degree of coverage for autism treatment. Most Medicaid plans cover Applied Behavioral Analysis when deemed medically necessary. Yet insurance companies may not reimburse the full cost or the length of time a child really needs.  Children with autism are eligible for educational services through their public school system.

He is enraged. It is 8:30 P.M. and she has not started her homework. Dad yells at her, \"Get off the phone.” She screams back, “Later,” and the daily battle has begun. Threats fly, tears flow and doors slam.  This is not an unusual story. Children naturally resist homework to one degree or another. After a long day of concentrating at school, coping with pop quizzes and other stresses, and participating in soccer, ballet or football, most kids feel tired and would rather call a friend or play a game. Furthermore, many kids experience homework as being forced upon them by their parents and feel angry and resentful.  In the situation above, like most parents, Dad’s expectations are high. He loves his daughter and worries that if Sophie does not do her homework, she might fail in school. He believes that it is his job to prevent this from happening. If his own parents handled a similar situation by screaming at him, he may unconsciously be repeating the same approach with Sophie.  Other issues from a parent\\'s past can come into play and intensify these conflicts. If this father took school very seriously, and it was an area of life in which he succeeded, he may feel enraged that Sophie is not relating to her work in the same way. He may become equally distraught if he failed miserably in school and wants desperately for his daughter to do better.  As we can see, homework is ripe for parent/child battles and must be managed carefully.  An important goal for parents is to communicate respectfully with their child, stress the importance of homework, and provide the needed guidance and support the child requires. Here are some steps a parent can take to end homework battles:  Stay calm. If your child is resisting doing his homework, and you feel a scream coming on, take some deep breaths, count to 10, or walk out of the room for a few minutes. If you start to fight, both you and your child will get upset, your child will co-operate less and may even feel too stressed to work. It’s better to approach your child supportively and make this a fact-finding and teaching moment.  Talk, don’t yell. Set a limit in a positive way. Dad might simply point to his watch or tell his daughter the facts in a straightforward way, for instance, “It’s 8:15 and you need to start your homework.” She’ll feel more respected and ready to cooperate. Always keep in mind that in the final analysis your child’s self-esteem and your relationship are more important than the homework.  Go over the rules. Having helpful rules in place, such as, homework is done right after school, or there are no phone conversations until you finish your homework, is more effective than relitigating the issues each day. Some parents help their child prepare a weekly schedule at the beginning of the school year and include some allotted time to speak with friends or play games.  Explain the reason for homework. Stress that homework is required by the teacher, that it has positive value, and it is part of every student’s responsibility. You might tell him that the goal of homework is for kids to review the material that was covered in class so it will be absorbed better. It also helps children to develop organizational, time management, and problem-solving skills, so they can function well in life. This comprehension will diminish the perception that you are forcing the work upon him and will make him less combative. If children understand at an early age that homework is an important part of their job, it is more likely to become part of the daily routine.  Acknowledge her feelings. If your child is resisting her work and says, “I hate homework” or “I don’t want to do it,” accept and acknowledge her emotions. You might say, for instance, “I know it’s hard for you to do work after school. You’ve worked hard all day and you’d rather relax.” (She still will need to do it, of course.) If you fight her feelings she will become angry, and resist you. When your child becomes overwhelmed by a task, and panics or becomes tearful, tell her, “I can see this work is hard for you,” and reassure her that she will be able to work it through. When possible try not to jump in to solve a problem but guide her by discussing possible solutions. When you are understanding, she will be more likely to calm down and do her work. Sensitivity, flexibility, and compromise tend to be the most effective approaches.  Open up a dialogue. In the scenario above, Dad needs to ask Sophie why she did not start her homework, and then listen attentively to her explanation. Maybe her friend had called about a problem, and Sophie was trying to support her. Then, Dad could help her to think through better solutions. For instance she might tell her friend, “I’ll talk to you for a few minutes now, and call you back when I’m done with my homework.”  If your child resists homework every night, explore all the possible causes of the problem. Are there any physical problems that are interfering with the task? Is he getting enough sleep? Is he tired because he is overscheduled with too many activities? Determine if your child is avoiding his homework because he doesn’t understand the work and needs help. If you cannot provide the assistance, find a family member who can or arrange for a tutor. A high school student might be able to work effectively with your child at a lower cost. Often, an objective person is a good idea to help you end daily homework battles, in any case.  Examine whether your child is having any emotional problems at school. Maybe your child isn’t getting along with her teacher or is dealing with some tough social issues such as bullying or cliques. If this is the case, you might consider seeking help from a school counselor or a mental health professional outside of school.  To cover every base, make sure to examine your family situation. Is it possible that your child feels that her sibling gets a great deal of praise as the “genius” of the family and she feels that she cannot compete? Maybe the new baby in your home is capturing most of your attention. Perhaps you have gotten busier at work and are less available. Sometimes a child can drag out the homework or engage in battles to keep your focus on her. To a child negative attention is often better than none.  Examine your role. Some well-intentioned parents become overly involved in their child’s work and take over responsibility for the homework. This approach communicates to the child that he should rely upon the parent and that the parent might not believe the child is capable of accomplishing the work on his own. Before you know it, the child will develop the maddening pattern of being unable to start his work on his own. He is used to the parent jump-starting the process. If you micromanage your child’s homework, he will not learn the skills he needs to do it independently.  It will help if you avoid sitting next to your child or standing over her as she does her work. Many battles begin over the child’s natural dawdling, such as dropping pencils or sitting upside down in her chair, and if you witness such behavior you are very likely to get upset. Children have a hard time sitting still and will need to do their dance to release tension. If you watch her too closely doing her homework, you might also observe her mistakes and be inclined to correct her. Your child needs to go through her own trial-and-error process to solve problems and might arrive at the right answer by herself if she perseveres. If you critique her too much, it can make her feel insecure, and she might conclude that you know the answers better than she does and cause her to become more reliant on you. You also do not want to communicate that only perfection will do. She may be afraid to try and resist her work.  Self-analysis. It is crucial for parents to examine their early experiences with school and homework, and change their approach if any underlying patterns are adding to the stress in the parent/child relationship. For instance, if Dad recognizes that his own father was a screamer, he might take a step back, remember how badly this made him feel, and try to approach the situation more calmly.  Teach your child skills. If your child has an upcoming project that is overwhelming him, you might help him break down the tasks, prioritize the steps, and set up a schedule so it will not be a rushed job at the end. It’s also helpful to teach your child some relaxation skills to use when he becomes tense, such as deep breathing or taking a short walk.  Your job as a parent is to take an interest in your child’s work, be supportive and encouraging, and help your child learn the skills she needs. Most of all, you want her to grow up feeling self-confident, independent, and capable of handling life’s challenges on her own.

Those who enjoy rising at 6:00 am, eating boxed lunches, and doing monotonous homework look forward to the school year because they crave a fresh start, relish the opportunity to learn new things, and anticipate connecting with old friends or making new ones. However, not everyone loves school! For those who despise the school experience, starting the new academic year can be a source of incomparable stress that triggers anxiety, frustration, and even fear.  The first step toward curing academic tension and the inevitable emotions of boredom, apathy, anger, or irritability is awareness of what may cause the anxiety in the first place. Unfortunately, humans are notoriously bad at accurately identifying their true motives and explaining why they prefer to avoid certain environments. If you hear comments from kids such as “school is stupid,” “we never learn anything” and “the teacher doesn’t like me” it is possible these remarks are smokes screens designed to psychologically insulate the student from what they anticipate might happen when school begins. However, as a parent there are at least five concrete steps that you can take to avoid a potentially negative school experience (and nine months of aggravation and fighting with the kids).  Create an end of summer routine  One delightful aspect of summer life is tranquility. Alarm clocks are off, parents are dreaming of vacation, and the thought of deadlines is a distant memory. The dog days of August minimally promote relaxation, a state of mind that is radically different than what is needed for success during the school year. However, one of the most important aspects of success for adults and children alike is structure and routine. Research reveals that students who prepare in advance for the challenges of school have more positive emotions about school and perform better academically (Struthers, Perry, & Menec, 2000). You can create a proxy routine by scheduling leisure activities according to certain times, offering kids the opportunity to journal the highlights of a summer vacation, or have them make to-do lists. These techniques promote a mindset of consistency and structure which can easily be transitioned into the mechanized rigors of the school year.  Set reasonable expectations  One of the most common drivers of student stress is the perceived inability to meet the expectations of parents and teachers (Englund, Luckner, Whaley, & Egeland, 2004). When children (or adults) believe they lack intellectual horsepower to be successful they often put forth less effort and become resistant to academic challenges. While it is crucial for parents to provide academic support and encourage educational interest, setting unrealistic learning goals like earning straight A’s or getting a perfect test score can backfire. Students often mistakenly believe that they should master course content almost immediately. Parents who remind kids that learning new material takes time and effort will ease academic tension. Students need to believe that it is okay to allow themselves to learn – and fail- and should be commended for having the courage to admit when they don’t know something.  Avoid comparisons to others  One reason students may dread the return to school is because they feel inferior when comparing themselves to others. Points of comparison set the boundaries for our goals and behaviors. Often kids will compare themselves to smarter or more popular classmates and feel inferior, which in turn promotes social anxiety. Conversely, downward comparisons can result in the student feeling better about themselves, but gives the learner a false sense of academic superiority. Regardless of the type of comparison, when we set goals and targets in comparison to others we may still come up short. Parents can help their student by encouraging comparisons to one’s own past performance. When kids realize that they have improved from prior years they will feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, which in turn will help them associate school with positive emotions rather than frustration or failure.  Accentuate the positive  Let’s face it, for many returning to school means getting up early, effortful concentration, and less discretionary time for the activities we prefer to do. However, school also provides opportunities that may not exist during the summer. The return to school often means more access to friends and socialization, the ability to participate and attend school clubs and athletic events, field trips, and yes, even the opportunity to learn new things. Neurological research reveals that the acquisition of new skills and abilities gives our brain a similar sensation as the one we experience when we win money and receive rewards (Mizuno, Tanaka, Ishii, et al., 2008). Thus, parents have a prime opportunity to shift student mindset toward a focus on the benefits of school, which may or may not include academics. If a student believes that there is some practical benefit from school engagement, their motivation to enthusiastically attend school should be measurably increased.  Provide emotional and academic support  Contrary to some popular beliefs, success in school is NOT an individualized effort where the student takes exclusive responsibility for their own results (De Bruyckere & Hulshof, 2015). Achievement is a three-way effort that is most successful when parents, teachers, and students share involvement and mutually commit to student learning outcomes. Commitment begins with encouragement, but also includes modeling positive behaviors (like reading books and helping with homework when necessary). Parents should avoid constantly judging learning outcomes (grades) or belittling the learner for questionable effort and lack of academic interest. When I wrote my motivation textbook, I interviewed celebrities in various careers and identified one common success theme. Regardless if they were famous politicians, entrepreneurs, athletes, or performers—every superstar had a coach who gave them realistic and supportive feedback that helped them develop skills and reach their potential. No one achieved success on their own! Consider being a coach first, and a parent second, as the best remedy to make the transition from summer to school a reason for everyone to celebrate!  ------------------  Dr. Bobby Hoffman is a university professor and author who dreads the end of summer.

One, because children are such a gift, and I love seeing them grow up healthy, happy, and strong.  Two, because there’s so much misunderstanding about how to parent, how to implement positive discipline, what kinds of rules are appropriate for which age groups, and so on.  Something I hear from frustrated parents quite often, sounds along these lines:  “I’ve tried to set rules for my child. I’ve explained that there will be consequences for misbehavior. I did all of that…and it still had no effect! My child is still being [unruly / rude / defiant / lying / manipulating / procrastinating, etc] and nothing seems to work!”  Sound familiar?  A lot of parents find themselves stuck in this “nothing is working” scenario—feeling increasingly annoyed because their child doesn’t seem to be responding to their parenting approaches. Some parents have found it helpful to ask themselves the following four questions:  1. Am I applying consequences for rule-breaking consistently or just…sometimes?  The answer may be a sheepish “no” or “yes, but…” or “well, kind of…”  Consistency is essential in order for consequences to be effective.  If parents only apply consequences for violating a rule “sometimes,” then their child may quickly learn that their parents are inconsistent and unreliable. The child may then try to use this information to their advantage—for instance, a child may choose not to cooperate, thinking, “I’ll take a chance and not do my chores…maybe I won’t get a consequence.”  It can be productive for parents to try becoming more consistent before they decide that consequences “don’t work” for their child.  2. Is everyone on the same page?  Sometimes, other caregivers (babysitters, tutors, grandparents, etc.) aren’t “in the know” about the rules and consequences that parents have established, or are not enforcing the rules when parents are not around. That can be a problem.  Parents are the primary role models for their children, but these other role models are influential, too.  Parents would be wise to consider taking a leadership role and making sure everyone’s on the same page—for the well-being and benefit of their child.  3. Am I tracking my child’s behavior with a chart?  Creating a daily “responsibility chart” is a terrific way to outline rules, chores, and required behaviors for a child—along with descriptions of consequences for non-compliance.  Charts can seem like miracle-workers because they can put a quick end to arguments and debates about “fairness.” Everything is put “in writing,” so to speak. \", \" A Parent's Role  Find a family therapist near me  If a child completes a chore (or follows a rule), they get a checkmark or a gold star. No compliance? No check, no star, and then parents have an opportunity to ask their child, “What is the consequence for what you did/did not do?”  Using a chart system can help children to build self-reliance and independence. It can also help to build self-esteem, as a child begins to realize, “I can stay organized. I can complete things. I am awesome. I can do this!”  (Not sure how to create this kind of chart? A sample behavior chart, plus instructions on how to use charts effectively, is also covered in my guidebook for parents.)  4. What kinds of consequences am I applying? Are they strong enough?  Consequences tend to be most effective when a child’s favorite privilege is temporarily removed—TV, video games, a cellphone, sleepovers, playtime with friends, and so on. \", ' If a consequence is not “strong” enough, a child is not likely to have much motivation to comply.  When parents set a firm rule, that they implement with love, and then apply a consequence for non-compliance, they are doing their child a huge service. They’re not being “mean.” They’re being an effective teacher.  After all, if parents don’t teach children that there are negative consequences for certain choices, who will?  So, before parents decide that their child is “immune” to rules and consequences, it can be helpful to consider making the four adjustments outlined above. A previously non-compliant child might then respond quite differently to parenting.  And one day, when a little one is all grown up? They may be deeply grateful for their parents’ unconditional love, unflinching boundaries, and the vital life lessons that their parents instilled.

But could we be damning them with the wrong kind of praise? Recent research indicates that congratulating kids for working hard -- rather than complimenting their innate ability -- is the best way to help them make the grade.  Carol Dweck, Ph.D., and Claudia Mueller, both of Columbia University, told fifth-graders who worked on a set of math problems that they \"must have worked hard,\" \"must be smart,\" or simply that they \"did well.\" Next, the students completed another problem set and were all told that they \"did a lot worse.\" The result? The \"hardworking\" kids were much more likely to take problems home for extra practice, to say they enjoyed the tasks, and to perform well on later tasks than the \"smart\" students.  Children praised for their natural abilities were not so resilient. Their motivation and performance suffered after their \"failure,\" and they tended to inflate their scores when reporting them to others. Ultimately, they began to measure their worth by their test results, believes Dweck. \"The kind of praise that all of society thinks is wonderful is the kind of praise that makes kids very vulnerable,\" she says. \"Parents need to focus on what children put into a task, rather than making implications about the worth of the child.\"  September 1997  Should You Leave?

', ' An age-by-age guide to what causes childhood fears and worries.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email ', ' Before Elijah Adamic-Sargeant, then 18 months, could enjoy a smoothie, he\\'d run into his room and cover his ears while his mom fired up the blender. \"He was terrified of the vacuum cleaner, blender, and hair dryer,\" says Susan Adamic-Sargeant, his Wayland, Michigan, mom. Usually a happy little boy, he would scurry in fright when he heard very loud noises.  Fear -- of loud noises, monsters, strangers, or other objects and events -- is a natural part of childhood. But while experiencing fear is stressful to children and parents alike, it should not be minimized. A part of normal development, being afraid is a sign that she\\'s gaining awareness of the world and trying to make sense of it, says Ari Brown, MD, coauthor of Baby 411 (Windsor Peak Press). Fortunately, most fears arrive at predictable stages, and with some insight, you can help your child navigate her fears and walk more confidently through childhood. ', ' Newborns have two fears: loud noises and falling. \"Babies\\' brains and nerves grow rapidly in the first two years of life, but they are born with very immature nervous systems,\" says Dr. Brown. \"This means that they cannot interpret or handle certain sensory input -- like loud noises or the feeling of falling.\" That\\'s why passing an infant around to loving relatives may not bother your baby, but set him down too fast or make an abrupt, loud noise, and he\\'ll cry in fright.  As her nervous system matures and she focuses on her surroundings, new fears crop up, and by 8 to 10 months, the concept of \"object permanence\" comes into play. \"Prior to this milestone, when things disappear, they no longer exist in the baby\\'s mind,\" explains Dr. Brown. \"But now, they understand that things disappear and they still do exist. So when Mom or Dad leaves the room, the child wonders where they went and when they are coming back.\" ', ' It\\'s often compounded by another fear at this age -- stranger anxiety, when the child is wary of anyone other than her primary caregivers. \"That\\'s a good sign, really,\" says Mona Delahooke, PhD, a developmental psychologist, in Pasadena, California. \"It means the baby is beginning to tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar faces.\"  Although it\\'s a healthy part of development, separation and stranger anxiety are especially frustrating for parents -- and it\\'s a tough cycle. Not only is a child afraid of your disappearing, but he\\'s also afraid of the caregiver you leave him with.  When Becky Gjendem and her son, 10-month-old Andy, flew from Florida to Nebraska, Gjendem eagerly anticipated the three-week visit with her mother. Andy had other feelings: He screamed when his grandmother held him and spent the entire visit clinging to his mother. ', ' To help your child handle separation, play games like peekaboo often, so she understands you\\'re still there even if she can\\'t see your face. Then practice leaving the room and wait for a minute before returning. When you\\'re ready to move on to real life, start out by leaving your child with your spouse first, then a close relative or friend, and finally a babysitter. Your baby should begin to see that person as a member of the family, and she\\'ll be happy to stay with her when you need to leave. Start with short separation periods, like a half hour, gradually building up time away from her over several weeks.  Whatever you do, when you\\'re leaving a child with these anxieties, don\\'t just sneak out, warns Dr. Brown. If you leave without saying goodbye, your child will have a shock when he looks for you and you\\'re gone, not only boosting his fears of your disappearing but instilling a lack of trust as well. \"Instead, tell him, \\'I\\'m leaving, I love you,\\' or have some consistent routine,\" says Dr. Brown. ', \" Along with a child's first steps around age 1 comes the growing need for independence and control over her environment. And that means things beyond her control can frighten her -- like jumping dogs, automatic-flush toilets, or thunder. \", ' Ginny Kress, a Lakeville, Minnesota, mom, recalls that her 18-month-old son was afraid of ants. \"He would panic when he was standing on the sidewalk if he saw one ant walking toward him,\" she says. To help make your child more comfortable with these creepy crawlers, let him explore the world of ants at a museum or in a book. The key is to help kids feel empowered, says Dr. Brown. \"The more power you give them to let them feel in control of their world, the better they\\'ll do.\"  Be sure to respect their feelings, too, even though you as an adult may not see any reason to be afraid. \"The best way to get a child to listen to you and learn to overcome any strong feelings is to tell him that it\\'s okay to have such feelings; that you have them, too, sometimes,\" says Robert Sears, MD, coauthor of The Baby Book (Little, Brown). ', ' By the age of 2, a child\\'s imagination kicks into gear as she imagines things she can\\'t see, which opens the door to fear of the dark and monsters. \"Parents might find themselves faced with a 2-year-old who used to sleep just fine but now is having a hard time settling down, or is waking up and asking to come into the parents\\' room in the middle of the night,\" says Dr. Sears. Try asking your child what she\\'s afraid of and what she thinks will help her overcome those fears. (While Dr. Sears advocates letting your child sleep in bed with you, if you\\'re uncomfortable with co-sleeping, you can stay in your child\\'s room a while to settle her down or let her sleep on your floor.)  Dr. Sears also suggests that parents establish calming night routines and skip bedtime stories with villains or scary pictures. \"Help them to not view nighttime as a stressful time,\" he says. \"Make yourself available to them so they know they don\\'t have to endure these times alone.\" ', ' Use your child\\'s imagination to his advantage by asking him to consider what would help him work through his fears. Adamic-Sargeant\\'s son, Elijah, became afraid of monsters in his room when he was almost 3. \"I asked him what would [help him], and he said that if he had five books in his bed, he would be fine,\" she says. \"Every night we put five books on top of the covers at the foot of his bed, and the monsters have not been back since.\"  While acknowledging her fears, try to keep things light so you don\\'t build them up either. If your child is worried that monsters may be lurking, make a ritual of checking in each closet together, let a big stuffed animal sit as sentry in the doorway, or grab a can of room deodorizer, label it \"Monster Spray,\" and give it a squirt every night to banish all things scary.  And remember -- these fears won\\'t last forever. Elijah Adamic-Sargeant, now 3, is nonchalant when his mom prepares smoothies in the blender. \"I used to be scared of loud noises,\" he told her. \"But now that I am big, it\\'s okay.\" That\\'s the sign of success, says Dr. Brown. \"Your child has to build on these experiences to be able to say, \\'I overcame it; it wasn\\'t a big deal.\\' Every time they have an experience they resolve, it makes them more confident in the future.\" ', ' While fears are a natural part of childhood, can they cross the line and become a true phobia? Not likely, say the experts. Genuine phobias in childhood are extremely uncommon, because a phobia is regarded as an irrational fear. And while most children\\'s fears are what we\\'d consider \"irrational\" given an adult perspective, from a child\\'s point of view, they\\'re very reasonable. After all, we may logically know we won\\'t go down the bathtub drain, but a child\\'s imagination might say otherwise.  Fears that may be labeled as phobias in adults (like fear of darkness, loud noises, or even bathing) aren\\'t considered true phobias in children. \"You could call these child phobias, but they are developmentally normal -- not like adult phobias,\" explains Dr. Sears.  \"For those normal childhood \\'phobias,\\' parents can gradually help their children become used to things by showing them how to interact gently with whatever they fear.\" Pediatrician Ari Brown agrees. \"Some kids have real anxiety about noises, crowds, strangers, and the dark,\" she says. But it\\'s not a phobia, and you can work together to help eliminate that fear -- thus preventing it from becoming a true phobia in the future. Says Dr. Brown, \"Respect the fear, address the fear, and empower the child.\"  Kathleen M. Reilly has two sons and lives in Raleigh, North Carolina.

', \" While our toddlers' brains are under construction to gain more control over their anger, Parents Ask Your Mom expert Emily Edlynn, Ph.D., says we can help in two critical areas: co-regulation and communicating that we are comfortable with anger as long as everyone stays safe.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email \", ' When my 3-and-half-year-old gets mad, she looks at you with squinted eyes, clenched teeth, and sometimes growls. It\\'s evident she is very angry, and seems to get angry quite often when she doesn\\'t get her way or is told no. Before, she would hit and kick. I was able to get her away from doing that by allowing her to use her expressions to show anger, but now we are here. What is the best way to help her express her anger in a healthy way?  I am going to re-frame your situation: your 3-year-old shows self-control and progress that you both should be proud of! Your work with her has clearly paid off. At her age, growling with an angry face is expressing anger in a healthy way because no people or property are harmed in the process. I suggest switching up the question: \"How do I keep helping her express anger in healthy ways?\" What you continue to do with her during these angry episodes matters as her brain develops emotional regulation skills with every passing day of big feelings and not getting exactly what she wants. ', \" I have noticed in my work with families, and in real life knowing anyone parenting children, that anger can be our toughest emotion to navigate. Our childhood experiences with adults expressing anger can play out with our own children. Seeing our child's anger may be an emotional trigger for those whose caregivers blew up easily, or unfamiliar territory for those whose caregivers withdrew and went silent when angry, communicating that expressing anger is not permitted. Because anger makes us uncomfortable for a range of reasons, we often convey to our children to express emotions . . . except anger. If we get more comfortable with anger as a natural human emotion, we help our children embrace their own, eventually without hurting anyone—or growling. \", \" The young child has the brain parts to feel strong emotions suddenly, but not yet the brain development to harness these emotions. In working with children in my therapy office, I start with the basics of emotions with almost every child regardless of age, like noticing how they feel in their bodies, labeling the feelings, and then articulating emotions to eventually replace exploding behaviors. In my years of therapy practice and motherhood, I can attest that young children most often do not have the ability to calmly state how they are feeling when angry. It's too complex for their brains—it means noticing, stopping a strong impulse, having insight, and then being able to put words to a highly emotional experience. (Side note: how many adults do you know who struggle with this?) \", \" There's a very important concept from child development critical for your dilemma: scaffolding. This refers to helping our children build important skills in a way that matches the skills they already have, and their readiness to level up. You have done this by helping your daughter replace destructive acts of anger with facial expressions and vocalizations that express her anger safely. It sounds like you see the next level as replacing this type of expression with behavior that feels more socially appropriate than acting like a caged animal!  Because it is probably a high bar for a 3-year-old to express anger calmly with words, I recommend focusing on two goals as the next developmental steps: physically regulating strong emotion and becoming comfortable with her anger. Mastering these coping skills ultimately dials down the intensity of anger, and will give her emotional regulation tools to last a lifetime. The great news is how much influence adults have on children this age, so you and her other caregivers can be her greatest emotional teachers. \", ' This may sound a bit fancy, but self-regulation is actually one of our most powerful strategies for emotional health: learning to calm our bodies when in distress. Regulating with your daughter, called co-regulation, helps her feel how her nervous system shifts from high alert to calm. High alert, which happens when we feel intense emotions like fear and anger, can include a racing heart, heated up body temperature, tense muscles, and rapid breathing. When my 7-year-old son—known for his big emotions—gets heated, sometimes I take his hand in mine, put it on his chest, and simply say, \"feel your heart right now.\" Toddlers and preschoolers (and some 7-year-olds) need us to regulate with them, which means we need to be regulated (aka calm). When we stay calm and offer physical comfort like hugging, sitting them on our laps, or holding hands, our calmer nervous systems help their little bodies better regulate those big emotions. ', ' The next greatest gift you can offer as a parent is modeling that anger is an acceptable emotion. We achieve this by showing that we are comfortable with our children being angry. This means avoiding two common traps: talking them out of their anger, and becoming overwhelmed by it ourselves. Our youngest children\\'s anger can look quite ridiculous on the surface, so it\\'s easy to say, \"this is so not a big deal—calm down!\" (I\\'ve done it.) When possible, however, validating \"you\\'re angry because you\\'re not getting what you want, and that is really hard\" offers empathy that goes a long way.  I\\'ve had my share of moments wanting my kids to just stop being upset, but I\\'ve learned how important it is to stick in there with the distress as often as I can, and to resort less often to shutting down the anger (my own yelling) or escaping it (tuning out with some Facebook scrolling). Just like when they are sad and you sit next to them rubbing their backs while they cry, you can show them they can feel angry and get through it: \"I see you are really angry. I\\'m here when you\\'re ready to sit in my lap.\" Note: we accept all emotions, but not all behaviors! While they are angry, we continue supporting safety. \"It\\'s fine to be angry, but not to punch me.\"  Once their bodies are calm, you can then guide dialogue about what made them angry, how it felt, and what helped it pass. This helps children practice self-awareness, identify coping strategies, and build confidence that anger passes, just like the scariest thunderstorms eventually end. ', \" With time, practice, and buckets of patience, I promise your daughter will progress beyond the angry animal stage. Accepting the emotion of anger itself while you work on expression skills at each developmental stage will prepare her well for long-term emotional health. She's fortunate to have such a wise and invested parent, even if you get angry about her anger sometimes. After all, you're both only human, and at least she knows you'll always be there for her. Even when she growls.  Submit your parenting questions here, and they may be answered in future 'Ask Your Mom' columns.

Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  When my husband Alex and I began writing our cookbook, Pretty Simple Cooking, we were a family of two. Weeks before our manuscript was due, we got the biggest surprise of our lives: our son, Larson. We adopted Larson from birth, and he is the ending to a long story of searching for our family.  For years before Larson, we\\'d been running the food blog A Couple Cooks, all about the joy of cooking and eating healthy, vegetable-forward food--together as a couple. Suddenly, we had someone new to cook for. But instead of disrupting our life with food, we found that having a baby fit right into our routine of cooking and eating real food.  Now that Larson\\'s turned one and officially a toddler, we\\'ve been able to share our greatest love with him: food! And to our surprise, it\\'s been easier than we thought…so far, at least (fingers crossed!). Here are 10 pretty simple toddler-feeding strategies that are working in our house:  Start the day with real food. Breakfast is one of the easiest meals of the day for feeding a toddler and can involve minimal \"cooking\". Think low-sugar organic yogurt, whole grain bread with peanut butter, homemade oatmeal, fruit, and eggs.  Make foods easy to eat. At age one, Larson loves food he can hold and feed himself: whole green beans (steamed from frozen), red pepper strips, roasted carrots, bananas cut into strips, pieces of whole grain bread, etc.  Make dinners the whole family can enjoy. This is our biggest advice for feeding kids. Don\\'t cook for toddlers, cook for the entire family. The Smoky Lentil Stew (see below) from Pretty Simple Cooking is a huge hit in our family.  Season to your taste, then show how much you love it. Right now, Larson is more interested in what\\'s on our plate than his. We always season his food to our tastes so it\\'s not bland \"kid food\", and then taste and show him how much we love it. Once he sees us eating it and tries it, he can be hooked into sophisticated adult food.  Make all-natural sweet treats. Our household is into naturally sweet, just-sweet-enough treats. A favorite lately is frozen yogurt dots, where we make just the filling of our all-natural strawberry yogurt pie and freeze it into small disks on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once they\\'re frozen, we peel them off and keep them in a sealable container in the freezer; Larson loves one at the end of a meal.  Smoothies are big faves. As long as the flavor is balanced and not too bitter or sweet, smoothies are a great way to load on the nutrients for kiddos.  Eggs for the win. If all else fails and Larson is not into what we\\'re eating (which does happen), he loves scrambled eggs. We\\'ll whip them up if he\\'s not into a meal.  Opt for homemade versions of kid foods. One of Larson\\'s favorite foods is fries (of course!). Instead of restaurant or frozen fries, we make homemade oven fries, hand cut potatoes with olive oil that are baked in a hot oven until crisp.  When in doubt, add flair. Not only is this simplest tomato soup delicious and vegan (made creamy using cashews), it\\'s the perfect carrier for a bit of kid flair: star toasts! Fun-shaped foods can add excitement to any meal--and honestly, for adults too.  Be patient & keep the faith. According to French Kids Eat Everything, it takes kids at least 7 times to accept a new flavor, often more. So instead of assuming Larson doesn\\'t like a type of food, we think of it more that Larson hasn\\'t tried it enough times. And we try to eat meals together as a family, but if it doesn\\'t work out on a given night, we try again tomorrow. Alex and I believe that if we continue to make real, delicious food for our toddler and eat it together, he\\'ll enjoy it in the long run. And then we don\\'t sweat the small stuff.  Smoky Red Lentil Stew  Serves 3 to 4  2 large carrots  1 medium yellow onion  2 stalks celery  3 medium garlic cloves  3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar  2 tablespoons smoked paprika (pimentón), plus more for garnish  ¼ teaspoon cumin  1/8 teaspoon cayenne  1¼ cups red lentils  1 quart (4 cups) vegetable broth  ¾ teaspoon kosher salt  Freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons lemon juice (½ large lemon)  1 handful cilantro or Italian flat-leaf parsley, for garnish  Plain Greek yogurt, for garnish (optional)  1. Peel and finely dice the carrots and onion, then finely dice the celery. Peel and mince the garlic.  2. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots and celery, and saute until the onion is translucent, about 5 to 6 minutes.  3. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Then stir in the balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika, cumin, cayenne, and lentils and stir for another minute. Add the broth, kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Bring to a low simmer, then cover halfway and gently simmer until the lentils are just soft but before they start to break apart, about 7 to 10 minutes. Watch closely and taste to assess doneness. The finished soup should be brothy with the lentils just soft; cooking past this point yields a very thick stew (which is just as delicious but less soup-like). Stir in the lemon juice.  4. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with torn cilantro or parsley leaves, Greek yogurt, and a sprinkle of smoked paprika.

', ' Kids are facing a mental health crisis, with separation anxiety and social anxiety on the rise. Both conditions are treatable with the proper diagnosis and support. Here\\'s what parents should know.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Anxiety is one of the most common mental health issues in children and adults. People of all ages can experience feelings of nervousness, apprehension, panic, and stress. The occurrence of anxiety-related conditions has also risen in recent years, partly thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many feel uncertain about their safety and the future, and this is particularly true among children: After living in a proverbial bubble for months and—in some cases—years, some children are struggling to cope. This has led to a rise in social anxiety and separation anxiety.  \"COVID-19 increased anxiety disorders in children globally,\" says Shannon Miller, clinical director at ChoicePoint Health. \"The sudden drastic change of learning environments and social interactions set up unusual circumstances for children\\'s developing brains. COVID disrupted children\\'s lives—and their childhood—and the psychological impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly on children and adolescents, was severe. Researchers have noted an uptick in anxiety-related issues.\"  It\\'s important not to downplay this anxiety in children. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that nearly 10 percent of children ages 3 to 17 will experience anxiety at some point, and the answer doesn\\'t lie in praying they\\'ll grow a thicker skin.  Nervous, worried kids become anxiety-prone adults, and those who haven\\'t learned coping strategies can carry these concerns with them for the rest of their lives. Apprehension about school (especially if it\\'s the first day) is understandable, but when you see your kids really struggling, it\\'s critical to ask yourselves—and them—what\\'s going on.  Here\\'s what parents need to know to support a child with separation anxiety or social anxiety. ', ' If you find yourself asking \"What is separation anxiety?\", you\\'re not alone. Separation anxiety is basically a fear of being away from parents or caregivers. It\\'s developmentally normal for children under the age of 3, who are still learning to be independent. As kids get older, however, some may worry that something bad is going to happen to people in their absence, or they still feel lost and scared. Going to daycare or school can be difficult for children who experience separation anxiety, and they often experience something like the \"Sunday Scaries\" that adults get before the start of the workweek.For so many kids, the coronavirus pandemic made separation anxiety worse, because they grew accustomed to being at home. Spending so long on their own also made them \"too comfortable with the option of learning online,\" says Rebecca Rialon Berry, Ph.D., a psychologist with the Child Study Center at NYU Langone\\'s Hassenfeld Children\\'s Hospital, in New York City. \"When anxious youngsters know that an option for an \\'out\\' exists, they\\'ll often seek it out and persist until they get their way.\"  Adding to the issue, kids may live with separation anxiety disorder, which is a more serious issue than just being afraid of a new place. Unlike the nervousness experienced by a toddler starting school, separation anxiety disorder finds older kids exhibiting real dread at the prospect of leaving their safe, familiar haven. It may be particularly heightened when they are returning to school after a lengthy break. Cognitive behavioral therapy (and in rarer cases, medication) may help.Here are some separation anxiety symptoms in kids:  Feelings of worry when away from family or caregivers  Refusal to attend school or daycare  Throwing tantrums at the prospect of separation  Physical complaints like headaches, stomachaches, nausea, muscle tension, or difficulty sleeping  Constant need for reassurance (\"Do I have to go? Can you stay with me?\")  Unwillingness to sleep by themselves ', ' While some children find it difficult to leave their parent\\'s side, others struggle to make friends. Social anxiety can make kids deeply afraid and stressed out when they know they have to interact with other people. The National Institute of Mental Health describes the condition as \"an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others,\" and it turns going to school or a public event into a terrifying prospect. It usually affects kids between the age of 8 and 15, when they are just starting to step out on their own.  Once again, there was an uptick in social anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many children had limited social interaction. Global rates of anxiety and depression spiked by 25 percent in the first year of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and that certainly included cases of those with social anxiety. In the years to come, experts anticipate that the number of kids with social anxiety will continue to rise. Some say the mental health effects of the pandemic will be seen for a generation.  Be on the lookout for the following signs of social anxiety in kids:  Avoiding social situations, like sporting events, parties, and other extracurricular activities  Having difficulty interacting in a group—and having a limited number of friends  Withdrawing when placed in a group setting  Experiencing extreme worry and nervousness about being called on in class  If a child has social anxiety, they\\'ll likely have negative reactions to social situations. \"When avoidance of these situations is impossible, these kids may experience panic attacks or otherwise endure the experience with overwhelming distress,\" says clinical psychologist R. Meredith Elkins, Ph.D., the co-program director of the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"Rates of social anxiety disorder increase across childhood and peak in adolescence, which makes sense given the growing importance of peer relationships to kids as they enter middle and high school.\" ', ' It can be tempting to give an anxious kid a hug and tell them it will all be OK. But the most important thing for parents to do is acknowledge the anxiety their children are feeling, not try to somehow \"fix\" it.  \"Start by validating your child\\'s experience, letting them know that their emotions are understandable and that you accept their experience,\" Dr. Elkins emphasizes. \"Once you validate, express confidence in your child\\'s ability to tolerate their distress and do hard things.\"  You might say something like, \"You have done lots of new things before, and remember how they could feel hard at the beginning? But the more you did them, the easier they became. I know that you can be brave this time too!\" This pep talk might give them confidence without overwhelming them. ', ' \"Learning that we can tolerate our distress and do the things that scare us is crucial to developing resilience and confidence.\"  \"Avoidance fuels anxiety,\" Dr. Elkins says. \"Learning that we can tolerate our distress and do the things that scare us is crucial to developing resilience, confidence, and ultimately, to decreasing anxiety.\"Children with anxiety must be allowed room to breathe and process what they are going through. It\\'s especially important that little ones feel heard and understood, says Kerry Horrell, Ph.D., a psychologist who specializes in mental health care for children and adolescents at The Menninger Clinic in Houston.\"Rather than immediately attempting to negate their worry [by saying \\'you will have fun\\' or \\'that won\\'t be scary,\\' for example], help them name and put words to their fears,\" suggests Dr. Horrell. \"For really young ones, drawing and coloring can be a helpful way to express themselves. Expressing their concerns, even when they\\'re excessive or out of proportion, will help them to understand that they are experiencing anxiety, which can help it feel less out of control.\"  Remember: There\\'s no shame in getting your child some help, particularly if anxiety is affecting their lives. Seeing a mental health professional who is trained to treat children may be exactly what your kid needs.

', ' Share  Tweet  Pin  Email ', ' A: Dear i_m_huges:  Your son has begun to tell you \"NO!\" because he has discovered that he is a separate person from you, with his own feelings and wishes which are sometimes in conflict with your feelings and wishes. Congratulations! He has taken a big step along the long road of becoming an independent, self-reliant individual. When he says, \"NO!\" he is asserting his own healthy individuality. You do not need to make him stop saying \"NO!\" to everything--after all, it doesn\\'t really matter what he says; the point is that he is feeling disrupted and annoyed and your goal is for him to feel less disrupted and annoyed. The parent\\'s aim is to control the overall situation from the outset, so that a power struggle is avoided. Therefore, you will find it easier to get along with him if you try to side-step direct battles as much as possible by thinking ahead and smoothing things over so that he doesn\\'t get upset from the beginning.  For example, when it is time to change his diaper, you can manage the situation so that you aren\\'t directly interrupting him when he is in the midst of something he considers very important. Perhaps you can bring the diaper to him and change it while he plays, rather than calling him away and interfering with his interests. Little children are easily distracted from one thing to another. You can use this tendency to guide him, in a friendly way, towards the dinner table or out the door or whatever it is that he needs to be doing. Give him a few moments of preparation by telling him, \"We are going to stop in five minutes and put our coats on,\" so that he is not suddenly surprised by these events. Of course, it takes a bit more time to prepare a toddler for these inevitable interruptions and transitions--but it will help him if you give him this extra time and attention during this phase.  Toddlers are often touchy about everything and difficult to get along with. They have a need to feel in control and in charge and the boss of every little thing. But this normal behavior is usually less trouble if the parent can make the effort to be especially diplomatic and respectful of the toddler\\'s need to feel in control. Toddlers feel pushed around by the same requests that they used to follow gladly when they were younger--the parent often experiences sudden panic when this happens, as if the child who used to be cooperative has overnight become a grouchy opponent. But you can help your son gradually outgrow the \"NO!\" stage by keeping your cool and side-stepping a direct battle of wills whenever you can.

', ' Temper tantrums can make you question your parenting skills, but they’re actually a normal part of toddlerhood. Here\\'s why they happen and how to handle them—without losing your mind.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  When your kid\\'s in the middle of a tantrum, it can be tough to keep from having an outburst of your own. \"Meltdowns are terrible, nasty things, but they\\'re a fact of childhood,\" says Ray Levy, Ph.D., a Dallas-based clinical psychologist and co-author of Try and Make Me! Simple Strategies That Turn Off the Tantrums and Create Cooperation. \"Young kids—namely those between the ages of 1 and 4—haven\\'t developed good coping skills yet. They tend to just lose it instead.\"  If your toddler has been experiencing temper tantrums, it\\'s important to get to the root of what\\'s really happening—and as much as possible, to keep your own emotions in check. Keep reading to learn the best tips for dealing with toddler temper tantrums and why they happen. ', ' According to Dr. Levy, at its core, every tantrum results from one simple thing: not getting what they want. \"For children between 1 and 2, tantrums often stem from trying to communicate a need—more milk, a diaper change, that toy over there—but not having language skills to do it,\" says Dr. Levy. \"They get frustrated when you don\\'t respond to what they\\'re \\'saying.\\'\"For older toddlers, temper tantrums are more of a power struggle. \"By the time kids are 3 or 4, they have grown more autonomous,\" Dr. Levy continues. \"They\\'re keenly aware of their needs and desires—and want to assert them more.\"  By the time your child reaches preschool, they can use their words to tell you what they need, but that doesn\\'t mean their tantrums are over. They are still learning how to handle their emotions, and a minor disagreement can escalate quickly. Because your child values their growing independence, they may feel especially frustrated when they need help. Some lose it when they try to do something challenging, like tying their shoes, and realize they can\\'t do it alone.  It helps to remember that tantrums are not a sign of bad parenting In fact, they\\'re an essential developmental stage for kids. \"Tantrums help kids learn to deal with their negative emotions,\" says clinical psychologist Linda Rubinowitz, Ph.D., a marriage and family therapist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Illinois. \"Sometimes children get so overwhelmed by their new independence that they get overstimulated and melt down.\" When they do, you\\'re the one they\\'re counting on to pick them up. ', ' While there\\'s no one right way to deal with a toddler\\'s temper tantrum, most experts agree on what doesn\\'t work. At the top of the \"don\\'t\" list are yelling and spanking (or hitting of any kind), but tactics such as bribing, begging, and giving in aren\\'t great either. \"If you give in, you are rewarding the tantrum and ensuring that it will happen again and again,\" says Dr. Rubinowitz. Kids need to know that \"no\" means \"no,\" even if they are upset about it.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), parents who react calmly and consistently to their toddler\\'s outbursts help their child understand where the boundaries are, which can help the child feel more protected and in control. The late sociologist Murray Straus, Ph.D., added one caution: \"When disciplining, it\\'s important to focus on behavior and not emotionally attack your child. People say, \\'That\\'s unrealistic.\\' But it\\'s not unrealistic to refrain from yelling at co-workers. We have to treat our children at least as well as we treat our colleagues.\"  Need help dealing with your own kid\\'s tantrums? Here are some tricks to try mid-meltdown. ', ' Does your child become aggressive during a meltdown—hitting, kicking, biting, or throwing things? Stop them immediately and remove them from the situation. Make it clear that while their feelings are OK, hurting others or themselves is not. Think: \"It\\'s OK to be angry at me, but it\\'s not OK to hit. I will not let you hit me.\" Or: \"Your block tower fell over and you\\'re mad. That\\'s OK. But it\\'s not OK to throw your blocks.\"  Remain calm, but be firm. When it comes to aggressive behavior, it\\'s best to have a zero-tolerance policy, says the AAP. ', ' Remember, your child will follow your lead when it comes to handling their anger. If you yell, they will end up matching your volume because, deep down, they want to engage and connect with you. Focusing on the fact that they\\'re feeling frustrated or sad may help you remain calm in the midst of the chaos.  If you do raise your voice, which happens to the best of us, apologize and ask for a do-over: \"I didn\\'t mean to yell at you. I\\'m sorry. That is not how I want to talk to you. Can we start over?\" In essence, model the behavior you want to see from your toddler—including making mistakes and taking responsibility for them. No one is perfect. ', ' \"Sometimes a kid just needs to get their anger out. So let them!\" says Linda Pearson, R.N., a Denver-based family nurse practitioner and author of The Discipline Miracle. (Just make sure there\\'s nothing around that could hurt them or others.)  \"I\\'m a big believer in this approach because it helps children learn how to vent in a non-destructive way. They\\'re able to get their feelings out, pull themselves together, and regain self-control—without engaging in a yelling match or battle of wills with you.\"  Stay close: Be there for support and as a beacon of calm. The idea isn\\'t to ignore and disconnect from your child but to let them feel their feelings in a safe, supported space. ', ' Sometimes, it can be a smart strategy to give in a little. Just be aware of the balance. Use this strategy too often, and you\\'re setting yourself up for failure by potentially reinforcing the tantrum behavior, according to Dr. Rubinowitz.  But there are times when surrendering a little bit is OK. While bribery (\"I\\'ll give you ice cream if you stop crying!\") is rarely helpful in the long run, you might honor your child\\'s request to play the same song over and over in exchange for a peaceful car ride, for example. ', ' Tantrums can often be sidestepped with commands that are brief, simple, and to the point. The more specific they are, the better (\"Don\\'t hit the dog\"). If your toddler is stuck in a mood, give them a clear idea of what you want them to do; \"Let\\'s color\" gives them a task to complete, and is much less vague than commands like \"Be good.\" A change of scenery can also be effective (\"Time to water the flowers!\"). ', ' \"Children have pretty short attention spans—which means they\\'re usually easy to divert,\" says Dr. Levy. If your kid is about to go off the deep end at the supermarket because you won\\'t buy the super-sugary cereal, try switching gears and enthusiastically saying something like, \"Hey, we need some ice cream. Want to help me pick a flavor?\" or \"Oh, check out the lobster tank over there!\" ', ' \"This may feel like the last thing you want to do when your kid is throwing a tantrum, but it really can help them settle down,\" affirms Dr. Levy. \"I\\'m talking about a big, firm hug, not a super cuddly one. And don\\'t say a word when you do it—again, you\\'d just be entering into a futile battle of wills. Hugs make kids feel secure and let them know that you care about them, even if you don\\'t agree with their behavior.\" ', ' Is your toddler screaming and crying because they can\\'t put on their shoes? Help them master that task so that they can feel a sense of accomplishment instead. If they want to do something unsafe, like climb a ladder, acknowledge their desire to do it, but restate your rule: \"I know you want to climb up high, but that\\'s not allowed.\" Try an alternative, if possible: \"You can climb the slide ladder at the park.\" ', \" If your child is having a public tantrum, pick them up and calmly carry them to a safe place. Take them to your car or a public restroom, where they can blow off steam. Once you're there, gently explain your position, and remain calm. Sometimes just touching or stroking a child can soothe them. \", ' Before you take your child grocery shopping, make sure they have eaten and slept well. Bring an interactive toy or a book in the car, then ask them to pick out things to buy at the store. You might even keep a paper and pen on you to write down the items they suggest, says Alan Greene, M.D., a father of four and adjunct clinical professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine.  At the end of the trip, read back some of their healthier food choices and let them get one or two things. Compiling a list will distract them and make them feel included, plus it promises a reward at the finish line. ', ' Toddlers don\\'t like surprises. The next time you\\'re about to leave the park or a friend\\'s house, defuse a potential eruption by giving them plenty of advance notice. They will be comforted by knowing what\\'s going to come next.  Tell them, \"You can ride your scooter two more times around the park, then we have to go home.\" This gives them a sense of control, and works better than saying, \"You can ride your scooter for five minutes.\" Since most toddlers can\\'t tell time, they\\'ll feel ambushed when it\\'s time to go. ', ' Public tantrums can be so challenging that some parents give in simply to reduce embarrassment, but this response only encourages children to repeat the behavior. \"Kids, even very young ones, are smart,\" says Alan E. Kazdin, Ph.D., a professor emeritus of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University. \"If you get angry or stressed, or cave in and let them get their way just to end the meltdown before more people start staring, they\\'ll learn that—aha!—it works.\"Your best bet, Dr. Kazdin explains, is to suck it up, plaster a Mona Lisa smile on your face, and pretend everything is just peachy. And what are others thinking? \"We know from studies that the only thing people judge is your reaction to the meltdown,\" says Dr. Levy. \"If you look calm like you\\'ve got it under control—even though you\\'re not doing anything to stop the fit—they think, \\'Now that\\'s a good parent.\\'\" ', \" After a tantrum subsides, revisit the original request you made that got your child so upset. If they threw a tantrum because you told them to pick up a toy, they should still pick up that toy once they're calm. If they went off the rails because you said they couldn't have a cookie, then don't give them the cookie when the tears stop. But when your child follows through and does something you asked of them, offer praise. After all, it's the positive behavior you want them to remember and repeat. \", ' Many children seem to snap out of a tantrum as quickly and inexplicably as they got into one in the first place. After it ends, go to your child, give them a hug and a kiss, tell them you love them, and move on. Dwelling on the outburst only makes them feel bad and may even cause the tantrum to start up again.  If you still want to discuss it with your 3- or 4-year-old, wait several hours before you do. Then, ask your child what set them off, and help them think about problem-solving approaches for the future. ', ' Don\\'t allow yourself to feel guilty or out of control because your child has a momentary breakdown. Though having a toddler shout \"I hate you\" can be hurtful, it\\'s important to remember that your child\\'s actions are not so much directed at you as they are a show of their own frustration. Tantrums pass and all of it will soon be a distant memory for your toddler. Make sure you don\\'t hold onto it, either. ', \" Coping with your toddler's tantrums can be difficult, to say the least. However, it can help to remember that they are challenging for your child, too. Often, your toddler is just working through their emotions and doesn't know what else to do to show they are upset. So, rather than viewing tantrums as a behavior problem, look at them as learning opportunities and times when your child needs extra support.

', ' Even the best parents struggle with how to discipline their toddlers. Follow these simple strategies for setting and enforcing boundaries with your\\xa02- and 3-year-olds.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  As a 2-year-old, Nathaniel Lampros of Sandy, Utah, was fascinated with toy swords and loved to duel with Kenayde, his 4-year-old sister. But inevitably, he\\'d whack her on the head, she\\'d dissolve in tears, and Angela, their mother, would come running to see what happened. She\\'d ask Nathaniel to apologize to his sister, give her a hug, and make her laugh to soothe her hurt feelings. If he resisted, Angela would put her son in time-out.  \"I worried that Nathaniel would never outgrow his rough behavior, and there were days when I\\'d get so frustrated with him that I\\'d end up crying,\" recalls Lampros, now a mother of four. \"But I really wanted Nathaniel to play nicely, so I did my best to teach him how to do it.\"  For many parents, doling out effective discipline is one of the toughest and most frustrating tasks they have to deal with, a seemingly never-ending battle of wills between them and their kids. Because just when a 2-year-old \"gets\" that they can\\'t thump their baby brother in the head with a doll, they\\'ll latch on to another bothersome behavior—and the process starts anew.  How exactly does one \"discipline\" a toddler? Some people equate it with spanking and punishment, but that\\'s not what we\\'re talking about. As many parenting experts see it, discipline is about setting rules to stop your little one from engaging in behavior that\\'s aggressive (such as hitting and biting), dangerous (like running into the street), or inappropriate (throwing food, for example). It\\'s also about following through with consequences when they break the rules. It\\'s all part of what Denver-based family nurse practitioner Linda Pearson, RN, calls \"being a good boss.\"  Here are 14 strategies that can help you set limits and stop bad behavior. ', ' \"If you\\'re always saying, \\'No, no, no,\\' your child will tune out the \\'no\\' and won\\'t understand your priorities,\" says Pearson, author of The Discipline Miracle. \"Plus you can\\'t possibly follow through on all of the nos.\"  Define what\\'s important to you, set limits accordingly, and attach appropriate consequences. Then ease up on little things that are annoying but otherwise fall into the \"who cares?\" category—the habits your child is likely to outgrow, such as insisting on wearing purple and only purple.  \"Keeping a good relationship with your child—who is, in reality, totally dependent upon you—is more important for their growth than trying to force them to respond in ways that they simply are not going to respond,\" says child psychiatrist Elizabeth Berger, M.D., author of Raising Kids with Character. You may worry that \"giving in\" will create a spoiled monster, but Dr. Berger says this anxiety isn\\'t justified.  For Anna Lucca of Washington, D.C., that meant letting her 2-1/2-year-old daughter Isabel trash her bedroom before she dozed off for a nap. \"I found books and clothes scattered all over the floor when Isabel woke up, so she must have gotten out of bed to play after I put her down,\" Lucca says. \"I told her not to make a mess, but she didn\\'t listen. Rather than try to catch her in the act and say, \\'No, no, no,\\' I made her clean up right after her nap.\"To balance things out, Lucca also took care to praise her toddler when she did something good—saying \"please,\" for example, or sharing her toys with her then-5-month-old sister. \"Hopefully, the positive reinforcement encouraged Isabel to do more of the good behavior, and less of the bad,\" she says. ', ' Some misbehavior is preventable—as long as you can anticipate what will spark it and create a game plan in advance, removing tangible temptations. This strategy worked for Jean Nelson of Pasadena, California, after her 2-year-old son took delight in dragging toilet paper down the hall, giggling as the roll unfurled behind him.  \"The first two times Luke did it, I told him, \\'No,\\' but when he did it a third time, I moved the toilet paper to a high shelf in the bathroom that he couldn\\'t reach,\" Nelson says. \"For a toddler, pulling toilet paper is irresistible fun. It was easier to take it out of his way than to fight about it.\"  If your 18-month-old is prone to grabbing cans off grocery store shelves, bring toys for them to play with in the cart while you\\'re shopping. If your 2-year-old won\\'t share their stuffed animals during playdates at home, remove them from the designated play area before pals arrive. And if your 3-year-old likes to draw on the walls, stash the crayons in an out-of-reach drawer and don\\'t let them color without supervision. ', ' Some children act out when they\\'re hungry, overtired, or frustrated from being cooped up inside, says Harvey Karp, M.D., author of the parenting classic The Happiest Toddler on the Block. If your child tends to be happy and energetic in the morning but is tired and grumpy after lunch, schedule trips to the store and visits to the doctor for the A.M., when they are at their best. Prepare them for any new experiences, and explain how you expect them to act.  Give them plenty of time to adjust to transitions, too. When you know a playdate is about to end, for example, you might say, \"In a few minutes we\\'ll need to pick up the toys and get ready to go home.\" The more prepared a child feels, the less likely they are to make a fuss over changes. ', ' \"Between the ages of 2 and 3, children are working hard to understand how their behavior impacts the people around them,\" says child development specialist Claire Lerner, LCSW, author of the book Why Is My Child in Charge?. \"If your reaction to a situation keeps changing—one day you let your child throw a ball in the house and the next you don\\'t—you\\'ll confuse them with mixed signals.\"  There\\'s no set number of warnings or reprimands it will take before your children stop a certain misbehavior. But if you always respond the same way, they\\'ll probably get it after four or five times.  Consistency was key for Orly Isaacson of Bethesda, Maryland, who stayed the course when her 18-month-old, Sasha, went through a biting phase. Each time the toddler chomped on Isaacson\\'s finger, she used a louder-than-usual voice to correct her—\"No, Sasha! Don\\'t bite! That hurts Mommy!\"—then handed her a toy as a distraction.  \"I\\'m very low-key, so raising my voice startled Sasha and got the message across fast,\" Isaacson says. One caveat: By age 2, many kids learn to shake their parents\\' resolve by being cute. Don\\'t let their tactics sway you away from being consistent and holding firm—no matter how adorable they are. ', ' Sure, it\\'s hard to stay calm when your 18-month-old yanks the dog\\'s tail or your 3-year-old refuses to brush their teeth for the gazillionth night in a row. But if you scream in anger, the message you\\'re trying to send will get lost—and the situation will escalate fast.  \"When a child is flooded with a parent\\'s negative mood, he\\'ll see the emotion and won\\'t hear what you\\'re saying,\" advised the late William Coleman, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School in Chapel Hill. Indeed, an angry reaction may only enhance the entertainment value for your child, so resist the urge to raise your voice. Take a deep breath, count to three, and get down to your child\\'s eye level. Speak firmly to them, and be concise.  Trade in the goal of \"controlling your child\" for the goal of \"controlling the situation,\" advises Dr. Berger. \"This may mean re-adjusting your ideas of what is possible until your child\\'s self-discipline has a chance to grow a little more. You may need to lower your expectations of their patience and self-control somewhat. If your goal is to keep the day going smoothly, so that there are fewer opportunities for you both to feel frustrated, that would be a constructive direction.\" ', ' Kids feel better when they know they have been heard, so whenever possible, validate their feelings and show that you understand your child\\'s concerns. If they\\'re whining in the grocery store because you won\\'t let them open the cookies, you might say something like: \"It sounds like you\\'re mad at me because I won\\'t let you open the cookies until we get home. It\\'s OK to be angry, but it\\'s not OK to whine.\" This won\\'t satisfy their urge, but it may reduce their anger and defuse the conflict. ', ' If you\\'re like most first-time parents, you tend to reason with your child when they break rules, offering explanations about what they did wrong and issuing detailed threats about the privileges they\\'ll lose if they don\\'t stop misbehaving. But as a discipline strategy, this approach (called \"overt-talking\") is as ineffective as becoming overly emotional, noted Dr. Coleman.  Why? Because an 18-month-old doesn\\'t possess the cognitive ability to understand complex sentences, and while a 2- or 3-year-old has better language skills, they still lack the attention span to absorb what you\\'re saying.  It\\'s best to speak in short phrases, repeating them a few times and incorporating vocal inflections and facial expressions. For example, if your 18-month-old swats your arm, say, \"No, Jake. Don\\'t hit Mommy. That hurts. No hitting.\" A 2-year-old can comprehend a bit more: \"Evan, no jumping on the sofa. No jumping. Jumping is dangerous—you could fall. No jumping.\"  By age 3, kids understand cause and effect, so state the consequences of the behavior: \"Ashley, your teeth need to be brushed. You can brush them, or I can brush them for you. You decide. The longer it takes, the less time we\\'ll have to read Dr. Seuss.\" ', ' When a child refuses to do something (or stop doing it), the real issue is usually control: You\\'ve got it; they want it. Whenever possible, give your preschooler some control by offering a limited set of choices.  Rather than commanding them to clean up their room, ask them, \"Which would you like to pick up first, your books or your blocks?\" Be sure the choices are limited, specific, and acceptable to you, however. Open-ended questions like \"where do you want to start?\" may be overwhelming to your child, and a choice that\\'s not acceptable to you will only amplify the conflict. ', ' It helps to turn \"you\" statements into \"I\" messages. Instead of saying, \"You\\'re so selfish that you won\\'t even share your toys with your best friend,\" try \"I like it better when I see kids sharing their toys.\" Another good technique is to focus on do\\'s rather than don\\'ts. If you tell a 3-year-old that they can\\'t leave their trike in the hallway, they may want to argue. A better approach: \"If you move your trike out to the porch, it won\\'t get kicked and scratched so much.\"  Make sure your tone and words do not imply that you no longer love your child. \"I really can\\'t stand it when you act like that\" sounds final; \"I don\\'t like it when you try to pull cans from the store shelves,\" however, shows your child that it\\'s a specific behavior—not them—that you dislike. ', ' It\\'s rarely obvious to a 3-year-old why they should stop doing something they find fun, like biting, hitting, or grabbing toys from other children. Teach them empathy instead: \"When you bite or hit people, it hurts them,\" or, \"When you grab toys away from other kids, they feel sad because they still want to play with those toys.\" This helps your child see that their behavior directly affects other people and trains them to think about consequences first. ', ' If repeated reprimands, redirection, and loss of privileges haven\\'t cured your child of their offending behavior, consider putting them in time-out. An appropriate length is one minute for every year of their lives. \"This is an excellent discipline tool for kids who are doing the big-time no-nos,\" Dr. Karp says.  Before imposing a time-out, put a serious look on your face and give a warning in a stern but calm tone of voice (\"I\\'m counting to three, and if you don\\'t stop, you\\'re going to time-out. One, two, three.\"). If they don\\'t listen, take them to the quiet and safe spot you\\'ve designated for time-outs, and set a timer. When it goes off, ask them to apologize and give them a big hug to convey that you\\'re not angry.  \"Nathaniel hated going to time-out for hitting his sister with the plastic sword, but I was clear about the consequences and stuck with it,\" says Angela Lampros. \"After a few weeks, he learned his lesson.\" Indeed, toddlers don\\'t like to be separated from their parents and toys, so eventually, the idea of a time-out can become enough to get them to reconsider their actions. ', ' When you want your child to stop being aggressive with others, offer safe ways for them to express their feelings—say, by hitting a pillow or banging something with a toy hammer. They need to learn that while their emotions and impulses are acceptable, certain ways of expressing them are not.  Older toddlers can come up with different options for handling challenging situations. For instance, you might ask: \"What do you think you could do to get Tiffany to share that toy with you?\" Listen to their ideas with an open mind, then talk about the consequences of choosing each option. ', \" It's highly unlikely that your child will always do whatever you say. It's normal for kids to resist control, especially when you're asking them to do something they don't want to do. When they do behave appropriately, consider giving them a little prize (on occasion). Rewards are like a spoonful of sugar: They help the medicine go down.  The judicious use of special treats and prizes—as well as lots of verbal positive reinforcement—is a way to show your child that you're aware of and respectful of their feelings. This, more than anything, gives credibility to your discipline demands. \", ' No matter how frustrated you get with your child\\'s misbehavior, don\\'t vent about it in front of them. \"If people heard their boss at work say, \\'I don\\'t know what to do with my employees. They run the company, and I feel powerless to do anything about it,\\' they\\'d lose respect for him or her and run the place even more,\" says Pearson. \"It\\'s the same thing when children hear their parents speak about them in a hopeless or negative way. They won\\'t have a good image of you as their boss, and they\\'ll end up repeating the behavior.\"  Every parent feels exasperated from time to time. If you reach that point, turn to your co-parent, your pediatrician, or a trusted friend for support and advice. ', ' Effective discipline starts with understanding where your child falls on the developmental spectrum. ', ' At 18 months your child is curious, fearless, impulsive, mobile, and clueless about the consequences of their actions. It\\'s a recipe for trouble. \"My image of an 18-month-old is a child who\\'s running down the hall away from their mother but looking over their shoulder to see if she\\'s there and then running some more,\" said Dr. Coleman.  \"Though they\\'re building a vocabulary and can follow simple instructions, they can\\'t effectively communicate their needs or understand lengthy reprimands. They may bite or hit to register their displeasure or to get your attention.\" As a result, the consequences for their misbehavior must be immediate. If you wait even 10 minutes to react, your child won\\'t remember what they did wrong or tie it to the consequence, says nurse practitioner Pearson. ', \" At age 2 your child is using their developing motor skills to test limits by running, jumping, throwing, and climbing. They're speaking a few words at a time, and become frustrated when they can't get their point across. They're self-centered, prone to tantrums, and don't like to share.  Consequences should be swift, as a 2-year-old is unable to grasp the concept of time. Since they still lack impulse control, give them another chance soon after an incident, says child development specialist Lerner. \", ' At age 3 your child is a chatterbox; they\\'re using language to express their point of view. Since they love to be with other children and have boundless energy, they may have a tough time playing quietly at home. \"Taking a 3-year-old to a gym or karate class will give them the social contact they crave and let them release energy,\" says Dr. Karp. \"At this age, kids need that as much as they need affection and food.\"  They also know right from wrong, understand cause and effect, and retain information for several hours. Consequences can be delayed for maximum impact, and explanations can be more detailed. For example, if they hurl Cheerios at their sibling, remind them about the no-food-throwing rule and explain that if they do it again, they won\\'t get to watch Bluey. If they still throw food, take it away from them. When they ask to watch TV, say, \"Remember when Mommy told you not to throw cereal and you did anyway? Well, the consequence is no Bluey today.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.  ', \" When a child is angry, argumentative, defiant, or vindictive for at least six months, they may receive a diagnosis of Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Several years ago, I was in the middle of a difficult divorce, and my mom had recently died. My young daughter was struggling to handle it all, and her behavior became increasingly troublesome. I knew that she needed help learning how to control her behaviors, and, to be honest, I needed some guidance on how to help her.  Based on a recommendation, I chose a psychologist who developed a specific program for children like my daughter. She diagnosed my daughter with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). The ADHD diagnosis was not surprising, but I'd never heard of ODD, and it didn't sound good. \", ' When a child is angry, irritable, argumentative, defiant, or vindictive for at least six months, they may receive a diagnosis of ODD. These kids will often lose their temper, be easily annoyed, and seem angry and resentful. Plus, they\\'ll argue with adults, intentionally defy or refuse to do what they\\'re told, and blame others for their mistakes or misbehaviors.  \"When I think of the child with ODD, I think of children who don\\'t always adhere to rules,\" says Dr. Jennifer Pritt, Ph.D., a child and adolescent psychologist whose practice is based in Mount Kisco, New York. \"When they receive a different reaction from others, it fuels a need or desire to get that attention and reaction. They lack the inhibition and impulse control to be able to stop and think about their behavior or the consequences. Some of these children also have ADHD, but ODD goes a little bit deeper because the reactions that they get from others drives the way they behave.\"  One of the most important things to know about ODD is that it\\'s not the parent\\'s fault. There are many reasons a child may have ODD. Trauma, such as divorce and death, is a common cause, and it was the reason for my daughter\\'s ODD. Other children may experience ODD as a result of struggling academically at school—their poor behavior draws attention away from their struggles. Or sometimes, there\\'s no rhyme or reason for ODD, and they simply like the reaction they receive when people respond to them in a certain way. ', ' Let\\'s face it, who wants to admit that their child\\'s irritable, argumentative, defiant behavior is so bad that they\\'ve received an actual diagnosis? Although more than 200,000 cases are diagnosed annually in the U.S., the name of the diagnosis can be scary, and the stigma hasn\\'t changed. Plus, not all parents are ready to admit that their child has a diagnosable behavior problem.  \"I tend to see two different kinds of parents,\" says Dr. Erina White, Ph.D., MPH, MSW, a therapist and clinical researcher at Boston Children\\'s Hospital, who also holds faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School, University of New Hampshire, and Simmons School of Social Work. \"One type knows that there\\'s something wrong, and they want to figure it out. For them, the labeling piece is important. For other parents, it\\'s very, very scary to think that their kid might be different, and they are grieving the loss of the dreams they had for their child. Just like with every loss, sometimes denial can feel really good, and you can spend a lot of time in that place, which is okay. It\\'s important to be kind and patient and loving to yourself because it is a loss for a parent, regardless of which type you are.\"  Plus, a lot of people blame the parents for a child\\'s behavior, not understanding that ODD isn\\'t due to a specific parenting style or action, according to Dr. Pritt. So it\\'s difficult to seek or share a diagnosis when parents believe that others will blame them. But, once the parents finally receive a diagnosis, Dr. Pritt witnesses a sense of relief.  \"If it\\'s not diagnosed and treated earlier on, it can become more of a conduct disorder or even a personality disorder,\" explains Dr. Pritt. \"It\\'s even tougher to treat teenagers because it affects how they develop relationships with their peers, and their behavior can become even more concerning, including drug involvement.\" ', ' The program I selected for my daughter involved a 45-minute session with her and the therapist and then a 45-minute session with the parents and the therapist. During my daughter\\'s sessions, she watched cartoons, played games, and learned how to recognize when her emotions began to escalate. Then she learned a variety of different skills she could use to control her emotions and her impulses.  During the parent sessions, the therapist explained the reasons for my daughter\\'s behavior, why they worked, and instructions on how to help her learn and use each skill. It was a lot of work for everyone, but the results were life-changing.  This research-based cognitive approach involves children and parents working together. It was up to me to remind my daughter to regularly practice at home. We would often role-play so she could practice a skill, and I reminded her to use a skill each time she began to escalate, something that\\'s very hard to do without a lot of practice. Some of the skills we still use regularly include taking a few slow, deep breaths or tensing/tightening your entire body for several seconds and then relaxing.  Dr. Pritt recommends that parents give their children a specific \"anger time\" where they can let it all out. Depending on the space available, let your child run, scream, rip up paper, etc., but before and after their \"anger time,\" they must practice the skill. It helps teach them that there is a way to regulate themselves.  According to Dr. White, there are two major ways to change ODD behaviors. One is what my daughter learned, which she believes is \"amazing, but also really hard,\" and the other only involves the frequent, repetitive practice of the skills.  \"With this, a child learns and practices skills so often that these skills become their default,\" says Dr. White. \"The tricky thing is that you have to practice a lot when you are calm. There are some great tools and programs to help with this, such as Mightier, that help kids learn these skills through play. With these sorts of games, you get to feel what it\\'s like when you\\'re upset and then practice bringing your heart rate back down over and over again.\"  Regardless of which method you choose, both Dr. Pritt and Dr. White emphasize that they have never met a child who wants to be bad. They all want to be good, even though they might behave poorly. When you teach them the skills they need, it will help them throughout their lives. ', ' It is important to note that it is natural for kids to resist authority sometimes. After all, kids will naturally bump up against boundaries as they go through different phases. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), kids who exhibit the following symptoms need to be screened for ODD. ', \" Kids with ODD will typically express a behavior pattern that is hostile, negative, and defiant. This pattern is also more severe when compared with other kids. It's one thing to have a meltdown, but if your child's meltdowns are disruptive to family and school life and are usually directed toward authority figures like parents, teachers, and coaches, then it may be time for a screening.  Kids with ODD will also show some or all of the following symptoms:  Frequent tantrums and meltdowns  Excessively arguing, especially with adults or authority figures  Refusal to follow rules or intentionally breaking rules  Constantly questioning rules and boundaries  Spitefulness, seeking revenge, or vindictiveness  Blaming others for their mistakes  Easily aggravated or irritable with other people \", \" If you believe your child is showing signs of ODD, talk to your pediatrician or family doctor. The AACAP explains that your doctor will look for a physical explanation for your child's behavior. If there isn't one, then they will refer you to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or professional mental health provider who is trained and qualified to properly screen and diagnose ODD.

Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  While most parents have raised their voices louder than they may have meant to at some point or another, unpacking why we yell and how yelling can affect our children may be helpful information to have the next time your 3-year-old throws a plate of food across the kitchen.  \"People yell because it\\'s their go-to response when they\\'re angry,\" says Joseph Shrand, M.D., an instructor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of Outsmarting Anger: 7 Steps for Defusing our Most Dangerous Emotion. Dr. Shrand also notes that there\\'s nothing wrong with feeling anger. \"It\\'s what we do with that anger that matters,\" he says.  Anger, after all, is a common emotion felt whenever we wish things were different. \"We feel anger because we wish our child would stop doing something or start doing something,\" says Dr. Shrand. For example, \"I wish my daughter wouldn\\'t slug her little sister,\" or \"I wish my son would tell me the truth about where he was last night.\" These are behaviors that parents wish they could change in their kids that might lead to an angry outburst.  But some efforts to change behavior are more effective than others, and parents who recognize the counter-productivity of yelling are more likely to pursue a better course of action. Here\\'s what really happens when we yell at our children, why it backfires, and what to do instead. And, as a reminder, if you are finding yourself yelling a lot or having difficulty regulating your emotions, it\\'s also important to schedule a check-up with your doctor, because for some people, mental health issues like postpartum anxiety can present in changes in behavior such as yelling more, irritability, and difficulty with emotion management. Parenting is incredibly challenging and it\\'s important to ensure all your health boxes are checked before you blame yourself too much for challenges you are facing! ', ' \"Yelling is about releasing anger; it\\'s not an effective way to change behavior,\" says Laura Markham, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids: How to Stop Yelling and Start Connecting. Dr. Markham says that when a child is scared, they go into fight-or-flight mode and the learning centers of their brain shuts down.  The fight-or-flight response is a physiological reaction that occurs when we experience something our brain perceives as threatening. As such, your child cannot learn when you\\'re yelling at them because their brain tells them this big person yelling down at them is a threat and effectively shuts down the other parts of the brain not dedicated to protection and defense. On the other hand: \"Peaceful and calm communication helps a child feel safe and makes them more receptive to the lesson we\\'re teaching,\" says Dr. Markham. ', ' \"The common thread that binds all people together is wanting to feel valued,\" says Dr. Shrand. For most of us, feeling valued by others is how we measure our self-worth and how we determine whether we matter to the world around us. When we\\'re yelled at, we see ourselves as inadequate and question our capabilities. \"Yelling is one of the fastest ways to make someone feel they don\\'t have value,\" says Dr. Shrand.  Dr. Markham\\'s observations are similar: \"When we\\'re angry and start yelling, we\\'re seeing ourselves as a hammer and everyone around us a nail,\" she says. In such a state, our children look like the enemy and not like human beings who we value and love. \"Our children should never feel like the enemy,\" says Dr. Markham. ', ' Studies have found that children who are yelled at are prone to anxiety and have increased levels of depression. Dr. Markham teaches that children pick up anxiety from their parents, and that the manner in which a parent reacts to any mistakes they make \"either soothes the child or stimulates their anxieties.\" Yelling, of course, is never a soothing experience.  What\\'s more, Neil Bernstein, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and author of There When He Needs You: How to Be an Available, Involved, and Emotionally Connected Father to Your Son, explains that negativity is the fuel anxiety and depression need to exist and that being yelled at creates an \"explosion of negativity that lingers for a long time.\" ', ' \"Yelling breaks your connection with your child and puts your relationship bank account in the red,\" explains Dr. Markham. When yelling is occurring, it can be a challenge to generate empathy for each other. Instead, yelling can put you and your child at odds with one another and makes them feel like you\\'re not on their team. Invariably, children leave interactions where they\\'ve been yelled at feeling defiant, defensive, and disconnected from you; not open to change, receptive, and more deeply connected.  \"In my 40 years as a psychologist, I\\'ve seen thousands of kids and have never had one tell me they felt closer to their parent after being yelled at,\" says Dr. Bernstein. ', ' Multiple studies have illustrated how yelling harms children. One study includes \"yelling or screaming\" as one measurement of \"harsh discipline\" in the home and concludes that children who are disciplined this way have \"poor school achievements, behavioral problems...and delinquent behaviors.\" Another study demonstrated that yelling has a similar effect on children as physical punishment; and a study in the National Library of Medicine deduced that verbal abuse and being yelled at frequently can even change the way a child\\'s brain develops.  Keep in mind, of course, that a one-off instance of you yelling is not going to permanently damage your children forever. These studies look at long-term patterns of yelling and other abusive behaviors. We\\'re all human and no one is perfect! What\\'s helpful is to understand what may be behind your own emotions, how you may be able to better manage them, and how to handle outbursts when do they happen. ', ' \"Children have a hard time learning to regulate their own emotions if their parents don\\'t show them how,\" says Dr. Markham, and parents who tend to yell every time they\\'re upset may wind up teaching their children to similarly overreact when they encounter frustrating situations of their own. In other words, yellers raise yellers.  Dr. Shrand explains that this happens, in part, because when we yell at our children, we activate their \"mirror neurons\"—the part of the brain that mirrors the behavior of the others—causing them to respond in kind. \"Anger begets anger,\" he says, and \"yelling at our children makes them want to yell back at us.\" The good news is, mirror neurons can also have the opposite effect—in children and adults. \"When was the last time you got angry at someone treating you with respect?\" asks Dr. Shrand. ', ' The first step to change how you handle your emotions may be to seek professional help from your primary care provider or a mental health professional. You may have some underlying health concerns contributing to your emotions, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid conditions, hormone imbalances, or postpartum mental health issues. You may also benefit from therapy to help you identify triggers and patterns, especially if you were raised in a household where yelling was common or you suffered any sort of emotional or physical abuse.  The second step will be dealing with the immediate situation of anger by acknowledging it. You can even do this out loud if you wish. It might sound silly, but recognizing your anger is actually a powerful step that literally changes your brain in that moment. \"The moment you recognize your anger, you activate your prefrontal cortex and interrupt your spiraling emotions,\" says Dr. Shrand. It\\'s about taking your brain from its feeling mode to its thinking mode.  There are several ways to do this, according to the experts:  Take deep breaths  Count backwards  Run in place  Shake out your hands  Say as little as possible until you calm down  Think uplifting thoughts that walk you back from the brink of yelling (i.e. \"My child needs my help right now.\")  Put your hands under running water  Even forcing a smile or a laugh can send a message to your brain that the situation isn\\'t an emergency.  After you\\'ve calmed yourself down, you\\'re ready to diffuse the situation instead of aggravating it further, explains Dr. Markham. This means approaching the situation that caused you to be upset in the first place calmly and mindfully by saying something like, \"Let\\'s try a do-over\" advises Dr. Markham.  Not yelling takes work, of course, and for most of us it takes a lot of time and practice to finally put an end to the unproductive and harmful behavior. But Dr. Markham teaches that it\\'s a lot easier not to yell when you have a strong connection with your child. Working on your bond when you\\'re not in the middle of an aggravating situation is a great place to begin.  After all, enjoying and appreciating our children for who they already are makes parenting more fulfilling for parents too, says Dr. Shrand. \"It\\'s much more rewarding to be amazed at who your child is than disappointed for who they are not.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.  ', ' Try these levelheaded ways to avoid everyday battles.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  It seemed like a reasonable thing to ask my 5-year-old daughter to set the table. I even asked nicely: “Honey, it’s about time for dinner. Can you set the table, please?” But instead of a chipper “Sure, Mama!” or even a grudging “Fine,” Belle responded with a loud “No!”—which sent my blood pressure skyrocketing and launched us into a prolonged back-and-forth. Despite my efforts to set firm limits, we had been having a lot more of these moments.  “Parents often worry that power struggles are a sign that they’re not parenting right,” said Jim Stokes, Ph.D., a psychologist at the Child & Family Counseling Center in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. “But being insistent is your child’s way of learning to be her own person.” Follow these expert strategies to help you maintain control. ', ' Your child wants to express his individuality by making his own choices, so try understanding his resistance. If you want him to do his homework right after school but he wants to do it later, ask him why. Is he hungry? Does he need a break first? Approach the situation as an opportunity to problem-solve with your child. In the case of homework, you might agree to a 20-minute break before diving in, but no screen time. Since he’s participated in the decision-making process, he’ll be more likely to agree to the boundaries that have been set. Look for various ways to empower your child’s growing need for autonomy. “Let him have control over other things like which cereal to have for breakfast or what clothes to wear,” says Laura Goodman, a licensed parent coach at Boost Parenting, in Duluth, Minnesota. Letting him have a say in some parts of his day may make it easier when it’s time for you to make the decisions. ', ' When your kid picks a fight, it’s not always a sign of strength. “Everyone is susceptible to stress, including children,” says Dr. Stokes. “If your child is tired, hungry, or overstimulated, she will be more likely to resist when you ask her to do something.” If you have to go grocery shopping on the way home from picking her up from school, you can predict she’ll fuss because she’s tired from a long day. Dr. Stokes recommends acknowledging how she’s feeling by saying something like, “I know you’re tired but I have to run this errand now. I’ll hurry and then we can go home so you can rest.”  Power struggles are also likely to happen during times of transition, such as morning and bedtime. “Your kid can’t always jump from one thing to another,” says Dr. Stokes. She may be reluctant to leave her toys and go to school or might be overwhelmed by the morning rush. Try using humor to lighten the mood or take a quick break for a hug or a back rub. ', ' If your child refuses to clean his room, you might be tempted to threaten to take away the iPad for the week. Regardless of whether you decide to enforce these consequences, try to stay calm; otherwise your child will be more likely to respond heatedly instead of rationally. “Try to identify your own triggers—such as feeling disrespected or unappreciated, or needing to assert authority—that make you initiate a power struggle,” suggests Tracie Giargiari, Ph.D., a psychologist at Thrive Health and Wellness in Longmont, Colorado. “Even if your child is the instigator, the situation changes when you remain calm.”  Sometimes, you may just need a five-minute break to decide how to handle the situation. You might say, “Since we’re both upset, let’s talk about this in a few minutes.” When you return to the conversation, you can either come to a solution together or explore the reason for his resistance.

', \" If your child has a speech disability that includes trouble pronouncing words, speech therapy may help improve language development, communication, and pragmatic language skills.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Speech therapy is an intervention service that focuses on improving a child's speech and abilities to understand and express language, including nonverbal language. Speech therapists, or speech and language pathologists (SLPs), are the professionals who provide these services. Speech therapy includes two components: 1) coordinating the mouth to produce sounds to form words and sentences (to address articulation, fluency, and voice volume regulation); and 2) understanding and expressing language (to address the use of language through written, pictorial, body, and sign forms, and the use of language through alternative communication systems such as social media, computers, and iPads). In addition, the role of SLPs in treating swallowing disorders has broadened to include all aspects of feeding.  Does Your Child Need Early Intervention?  Could Your Child Have a Learning Disability?  What Is Occupational Therapy?  What Is Hippotherapy? \", ' Some children may have excellent pronunciation and may even be early readers, but they may need speech therapy to improve \"pragmatic\" language, or the process of using verbal and body language appropriately in social situations for everyday purposes such as making requests, having conversations, and making friends. Other reasons children may need speech therapy include medical conditions such as a brain injury or infection that has affected their ability to communicate and an identifiable disability such as Down syndrome. Services often begin at a young age and continue as children enter school and start to communicate with written language.  What Is Verbal Apraxia? ', ' An SLP may identify a language-based learning disability in students who struggle to read and express themselves in written work. \"Language difficulties can have a major impact on a child\\'s ability to write,\" says Kathy Oehler, a speech-language pathologist in Carmel, Indiana, and co-author of I Hate to Write. \"In order to write, children must be able to put their ideas into words and organize those words into sentences. Also, language challenges make it hard for children to understand and follow directions. The SLP can help build these skills.\" To provide direct treatment, SLPs perform evaluations and consult with teachers to create language-rich classrooms. Therapy may be individual or include a small group of peers who face similar social and communication challenges. In either situation, the goal is to make language fun, develop friendships, and enable students to succeed in school.  What Is Your Parenting Style? ', ' \"Speech and language pathologists not only assess and treat for articulation, language and cognitive difficulties, but some also focus on swallowing and feeding,\" says Melanie Potock, an SLP and author of Happy Mealtimes with Happy Kids. According to Potock, \"It\\'s not uncommon for children who have trouble talking to also have feeding challenges. While children with special needs may be the first to come to mind, it\\'s not unusual for other kids to have both speech and feeding difficulties. Both speech and eating involve the fine motor aspects of moving the tongue, jaw, and lips in a coordinated fashion, and that\\'s not always easy to do!\"  The SLP might bring out some blow toys and whistles and have \"blow the cotton ball\" relay races to strengthen muscles used in speech and eating. Using crazy straws, a toothbrush that makes music, and blowing bubbles might also be fun strategies to help children tolerate different sensations in their mouths.  Understanding Speech Delays ', ' Speech and language pathologists work with children who have difficulty reading the cues from the social world, interpreting others, and using words and body language to communicate effectively and develop friendships. \"The pragmatics part of communication and language deals with issues related to social communication; which includes, but is not limited to social language,\" say Michelle Garcia Winner, M.A., and Pamela J Crooke, Ph.D., SLPS and co-authors of Socially Curious and Curiously Social. According to the authors, \"Attending to social information to process and respond to nonverbal cues provided by the context, people, and their language is difficult for students with social learning challenges -- autism spectrum disorders, non-verbal learning disability, speech language impairment, ADHD, etc.\" These students may benefit from a treatment philosophy called Social Thinking (socialthinking.com) that teaches about the relationship between how we think and behave and how others respond to us. ', ' Children who, for a variety of reasons are unable to speak, need alternative communication methods. Early intervention and preschool SLPs teach children (and their parents) how pictures and simple sign language enable them to communicate their needs.  School-aged children may be able to use computers or iPads to communicate through text or a voice synthesizer. According to Lois Brady, author of Apps for Autism, touch screen technology such as the iPad has made it possible for students to communicate and meet their individual goals using the same super-cool device that their classmates use. Furthermore, speech therapists are able to use the same device to teach speech and language skills through engagement and motivation.  10 Best Apps for Kids With Autism ', \" SLPs are readily available in public schools to evaluate and provide treatment. Parents may opt for private speech therapy offered in a clinical setting or have their child join a social skills training group. Ask the school guidance counselor or family physician to recommend a program with children of similar ages and developmental needs to your child's. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) website provides information about what ages children typically develop language skills. This information helps parents who suspect that their child has a language delay understand when to seek professional help.

But after stressing for so long, I realized forcing him to potty train wasn\\'t the way to go.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  When my boy was almost 3, he had zero interest in the potty. We had potties out around the house for months—one in the bathroom and one in the living room—hoping he might try one of them when it was time to do his business. We even tried to bribe him with cookies, new toys, and his favorite Netflix shows, but nothing stuck.  Very few kids were sporting diapers at his age anymore and it was no surprise to me when I found out a lot of moms around me were diligent in their potty pushing. The most popular method, based on the book, Oh Crap! Potty Training: Everything Modern Parents Need to Know to Do It…, seemed quick and simple: For three days, keep your kid naked at home and he’ll get it. And for other kids, that worked.  Then there was my son and me. At first, I’ll admit, I kept pushing off any real potty-training method because maybe I was the one actually set in our diaper ways. I liked the ease of changing him without having to run to a toilet at every outing. I liked the idea of long drives without stopping or whatever I imagined life would be like without the \"convenience\" of diapers.  Maybe my boy was feeling my no pressure no potty attitude because I remember reading him a potty book one night and he actually peed through his diaper mid-book! Or maybe that was a sign that we just weren\\'t ready.  Then I spoke to my son\\'s pre-school teachers, who were old school, and they offered a different approach: \"Don\\'t push it and don\\'t train him. What\\'s the rush? Let him tell you when he\\'s ready!\"  That was a relief for me. But many moms have to rush the potty training because some pre-school programs around the country won\\'t allow kids in with diapers. I was fortunate not to have to deal with that since the director at my son’s school in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York doesn’t believe in that.  \"When you force potty training with a child who is not physically, mentally, and emotionally ready, a parent can easily create anxieties, power struggles, shame, and a strain on the parent/child relationship,\" says Irene Balint-Wemer, a mom herself and also my child’s teacher. She adds if a program really understood a child\\'s development, they would change their policy and if they don\\'t, parents should look for a different program.  Some other moms I’ve spoken to have told me they didn’t believe in forcing their kids to use the toilet either. \"I didn\\'t use a specific method with my son, and I was pretty lazy about it, but he started using the potty consistently when he was about 2,” says Holly Scudero, a mom from Fairfax, Virginia. “No charts, no rewards, no timers, no timelines, or anything—just lots of talking, diaper-free time, and the patience to let him start telling me when he needed to go—although I did ask often.”  Still I wondered, when will my child actually be ready to shed those diapers? \"There will be natural signs of readiness. For example, his diaper or pull-up is dry in the mornings, he is showing an interest, or he is talking about how his friends go on the potty,” explained Balint-Wemer. She told me her little trick of putting a gum ball machine by the potty and giving her child a gum ball every time they went. She said her children eventually potty trained themselves and assured me it would happen, especially if I backed off.  We felt reassured but my husband was still a little antsy, especially because our boy seemed to be the last one standing in diapers. That’s when we decided my husband would be the one to read every potty-training book and come up with a plan of attack—but after our trip to Florida.  Only, that never happened. A week before our trip, our boy sat on the potty one night and did his business. We cheered! The next day, I took him to school in superhero underwear, told his teachers to take over from there, and hoped for the best. Yes, I had no idea what I was doing, but I just felt like that was the right next step, even though most potty-training books would have told me it was the wrong one.  The next two to five days there were accidents and messy ones! A friend actually told me to \"abort mission,” read the Oh Crap book she lent me, and try again, but I wasn\\'t going back in time. In a few days, he got it. He ran to the potty when he had to go, and even stayed dry in underwear all night long. It was a miracle! Or maybe it was just normal. Either way, I can say my son potty trained himself. ', ' What worked for me? Not sweating potty training and letting it just happen, then when it finally did, going with only underwear from then onwards.

', ' Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Both of my children were potty trained by age 3--during the day, at least. My older daughter had three dry nights in a row a few months before she turned 5, so we put her in underwear, and to this date she\\'s never had an accident. (She\\'s 9 now.) When my younger daughter\\'s 5th birthday came and went with her still in diapers at bedtime, I didn\\'t think much of it--different kid, different timetable. Her pediatrician wasn\\'t concerned, either. But then Lila\\'s 6th birthday passed, and she told me she was too embarrassed to have friends over in case they saw her Pullups in her closet. Shortly after, I heard a discouraging stat: Only 15% of bedwetters become dry on their own a year later. So if we waited for things to get better, it could literally take years. It was time to deal with this.  First, I wanted to rule out any medical causes for her bedwetting. (Excessive urination is a common red flag of diabetes, for example.) Once we learned that everything was normal, we focused on bedwetting treatment options. Research shows that medication is not as effective as a bed alarm. And age 6 is a good time to start using an alarm; younger children don\\'t respond very well. So my husband and I geared ourselves up for what an alarm would mean for all of us. Put simply: bad sleep, and a lot of laundry, for the next several months.  We had one huge advantage, which was a willing child. Lila was totally motivated to stop bedwetting, and she found the idea of an alarm sort of fascinating. We got the kind that has two parts: a sensor that clips to her underwear and a transmitter that attaches to the shoulder of her pajama top, beeping loudly when the sensor gets wet. (We also invested in a super-absorbent pad that we attached to the top of her mattress and always had a pile of clean sheets and blankets waiting on the floor.) We explained that when the alarm went off, we\\'d turn it off and help her to the bathroom. This was a key step, having her go to the toilet even if her bladder was completely empty. The hope was that she\\'d eventually turn off the alarm when she was wet and head to the bathroom on her own. But the goal was for the alarm to train her reflex system to tell her when her bladder was full and send her to the bathroom before she urinated.  I can\\'t say we saw much success. For the first several weeks, that dreaded alarm woke me and my husband--though not Lila--every night, sometimes twice. I tracked each night in a simple chart that came with the bed alarm; I didn\\'t see much of a pattern to her accidents. Sometimes they happened before midnight, other times they weren\\'t until 4 or 5 in the morning. We tried limiting how much water she drank, and woke her to use the bathroom before we went to bed, so there\\'d ostensibly be less urine in her bladder for the night. But experts don\\'t encourage that because while it does cut back on accidents, it doesn\\'t help the brain and bladder communicate with each other.  Then, through the good fortune of my job here, I met a father-son team of bedwetting experts in town from Israel. Jacob Sagie, Ph.D., and his son, Tal Sagie, M.A., have treated more than 30,000 bedwetters in the past three decades. They\\'ve now created a new program called TheraPee. It requires an alarm (though a different kind—I\\'ll explain), but what sets it apart is the online component.  The Sagies knew that they\\'d been successful with their patients, who ranged in age from 4 to 35, because they were able to meet face to face. With TheraPee, they\\'re replicating the in-person experience in the form of hundreds of brief video clips tailored to your child\\'s situation. Here\\'s how it works: You initially provide information about your child, including age, gender, duration of bedwetting, and more. Based on that data, the appropriate video will play, starring Tal, who speaks directly to your child, welcoming her to the program. (That\\'s him in the photo illustration above.) Lila looked at me in amazement and said, \"Is he really talking to me?\"\\x9d She was enthralled. This is the point, says Tal: \"The soul of the treatment is the therapist. His ability to establish a trusting relationship with your child, knowing how to motivate him, and always giving him hope and helping him believe in himself, are the key elements for success.\"\\x9d This is why the videos rely heavily on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. For example, your child will watch a clip that incorporates modeling by showing thank-you notes and progress charts from successful former TheraPee patients.  A word about the charts: They were a big deal for Lila. With the first treatment method we tried, I kept my own records. Dr. Sagie pointed out that we were missing a critical opportunity to motivate Lila and help her feel invested in the process. What\\'s more, my chart was ugly to look at. TheraPee\\'s online chart requires more information, including the size of the wet spot, the time of night the accident occurred, and whether your child woke up on her own. It\\'s easy for kids to fill it out themselves. And when they have a dry night, they get to put a blue star on that square. After four dry nights in a row, they get a red star. And after eight consecutive dry nights, they get a much-sought-after gold star. I couldn\\'t believe how genuinely excited Lila was to place her stars on the chart, and how much she was keeping tabs on which color star she was due for. After two weeks of reporting results, Lila would have another session with Tal, using videos tailored specifically to her progress. (One note: His accent is strong, and I was certain Lila was going to find it distracting. To my surprise, it only seemed to make her pay more attention to what he was saying.) In the video clips, he would praise her progress, cheer her on, give mini quizzes to make sure she understood what she was being told (\"What kind of star will you get for one dry night?\"\\x9d), and give us homework—daily exercises that would help strengthen her bladder or improve her reflex system. One such exercise required her to urinate for three seconds, stop for three seconds, and repeat that pattern until she was finished. (There are much more sophisticated exercises for children who use the program for a longer period than Lila did.)  Another difference this time around was the alarm itself. Lila wasn\\'t physically attached to it anymore (many kids resist that kind, says Tal). Instead, we put a sensor pad under her sheet that plugged into an alarm box right next to her bed.  Since mid-November, Lila has had a total of three accidents. She \"graduated\"\\x9d from TheraPee in early February. As a way of celebrating, Lila got to virtually meet Tal via Skype, which was nothing short of a thrill for her, after all of her video sessions. This isn\\'t necessarily typical, but \"we do our best to assist all patients by phone, email, or Skype if they need our help during the program,\"\\x9d he says.  The program isn\\'t cheap: You can either pay $279 for the alarm and unlimited access to the software, or $199 plus a $19.99 monthly fee (perhaps a better option if your child is very close to having dry nights). But the Sagies say their success rate with TheraPee is 90%, and it\\'s clear from these glowing reviews on Amazon that it\\'s working for many, many more children out there. If you\\'re interested, you can get a free consultation. And should you use it, I wish you and your child the best.  Kara Corridan is the health director of Parents. Now that Lila\\'s bedwetting days are over, she\\'s moved on to a loft bed, where she sleeps soundly every night.

', ' While autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually diagnosed in older children, there are some signs of autism in babies. Here\\'s what you need to know.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  What Is Autism?  What Causes Autism?  What Are the Signs of Autism in Babies ?  What Should You Do If Your Baby Exhibits Some of the Signs of Autism?  How Is Autism \"Treated?\"  What Is the Outlook for Babies Diagnosed with Autism?  ronnachaipark/Getty Images  Watching your baby grow is an unforgettable experience. But while every child develops at their own speed, failing to reach certain milestones can raise red flags. Some parents recognize the signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when their baby is around six to 12 months old—and maybe even earlier, says Thomas Frazier, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, autism researcher, and chief science officer of Autism Speaks. Here are the early signs of autism in babies and why prompt diagnosis is key to managing the condition. ', ' Autism is a complex neurological and developmental disorder that can affect social skills like playing, learning, and communicating. Individual cases of autism fall on a spectrum ranging from mild to severe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that autism affects one in 44 children today. ', ' Doctors don\\'t know exactly what causes autism, but it\\'s believed to be a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Certain circumstances also increase a child\\'s chance of developing autism. For example, \"if you have a sibling with autism, your risk of developing it increases to about 20% on average,\" says Dr. Frazier. Other risk factors include premature birth, low birth weight, delivery complications, and being conceived by parents with advanced maternal and paternal age. ', ' While most children are older when they are diagnosed, some parents can (and do) recognize the signs of autism in babies, depending on the symptoms and their severity. Of course, it\\'s always important to keep in mind that all babies develop on different timelines. However, it can be helpful to know the potential red flags to look for when it comes to development.  \"Pay attention to whether or not the baby is reacting to social information and the environment. Within the first year of life, babies start to babble and use gestures like pointing,\" says Dr. Frazier, adding that babies may also smile at their caregivers. \"Baby noises should have some social function as well, and they should try communicating with parents.\"  Babies with autism sometimes fail to communicate through sounds or gestures, and may not respond to social stimulation.  It\\'s important to note that the following criteria aren\\'t conclusive evidence of autism. \"They\\'re simply things we look for to determine if we need to further assess the baby,\" says Mandi Silverman, an associate psychologist at Positive Developments. Another social or developmental factor may be at play. ', ' Not following moving objects with their eyes  Sensitivity to loud noises  Limited facial expression  Poor facial recognition (especially new faces) ', ' Disinterest in certain sounds (e.g., not turning to locate where sounds are coming from)  Perceived lack of affection  Limited babbling  Limited verbal expression (e.g., not laughing or making squealing sounds)  May not reach for objects  Does not grasp or hold onto objects  May demonstrate limited facial expressions and/or emotional reactivity (e.g., not smiling on their own) ', ' May not crawl  May avoid eye contact  Limited or incomprehensible speech  May refrain from using gestures such as waving or shaking their head  May not point to objects or pictures  May appear unbalanced or unable to stand even when supported ', ' If you notice some of the signs of autism in your baby, Dr. Frazier advises scheduling a visit to your pediatrician. You\\'ll discuss developmental concerns, and the doctor will evaluate your baby for autism. \"We have evidence that suggests the quicker you can get a diagnosis, the earlier you can enroll in developmental and behavioral interventions,\" says Dr. Frazier.  Early intervention is meant to help autistic children develop to their own full potential. The brain can respond to treatments more effectively at younger ages, which can make interventions more effective. As your child gets older, those interventions might include speech therapy, occupational therapy, mental health counseling, and whatever else experts believe will help your child thrive. The ultimate goal is \"making the symptoms more manageable and enhancing life as much as possible,\" says Dr. Silverman. ', ' While an autism diagnosis may seem worrisome, many autistic children lead happy and fulfilling lives. Learning your child is on the spectrum is not a bad thing, nor should it be viewed in a negative light. Still, you may be wondering how you can \"treat\" your child\\'s condition. ', ' Depending on your child’s symptoms, one or more of these\\xa0therapies\\xa0may be useful:  cognitive behavioral therapy  behavior management therapy  physical therapy  speech therapy  occupational therapy  nutritional therapy  educational interventions  medication  Animal therapy, art therapy, and chiropractic care can also be helpful.  That said, it\\'s important to note that many autistic people do not want to be treated or \"cured.\" Rather, they view their diagnosis as a difference, one which makes them exactly who they are—and who they were meant to be. ', ' If your child has been diagnosed with autism, you are probably wondering what this means for them—and how it will impact their life. And while there are no guarantees or set answers, according to the Autism Research Institute (ARI), \"the prognosis for a child with autism... can be influenced by early intervention and treatment. For years autism was thought to be irreversible. While autism is a lifelong condition, there are now evidence-based treatments that can help and support people with autism.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.  ', \" Could this classic discipline technique actually make the situation worse? Learn what experts recommend, including a new and improved five-step technique for giving time-outs.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Time-out certainly sounds like a brilliant fix: A child spends a few minutes sitting alone, and emerges calm and cooperative. Parents often admit that it simply doesn't work—because their kid fights going to the time-out, cries, and calls out instead of sitting quietly, or gets even more worked up afterward. However, according to a recent study from Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, 85 percent of parents who use the strategy make mistakes that can reduce its success, such as giving too many warnings or talking to their kids, or letting them play with toys during time-outs. If you're ready to become a time-out dropout, consider when they will be most effective and how you can adopt other tactics to quell your kid's antics. \", ' Time-outs became popularized by reality shows like Supernanny, but the technique was first developed in the 1960s as a more humane alternative to harsh punishments that were common then. Before Arthur Staats, Ph.D., now retired from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, came up with the concept, teachers, and principals routinely smacked children with rulers, and parents spanked or whipped their kids with switches. Now—at a time when a video of a kid being paddled at school goes viral because it\\'s so shocking—most parents are embracing a more gentle approach. After all, decades of research have shown that children who have been routinely spanked are more likely to be aggressive when they get older, as well as to suffer from anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.  But a time-out isn\\'t benign either. \"When your child has a tantrum or a meltdown, she may be overwhelmed and unable to control her emotions,\" says Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., professor of psychiatry at UCLA School of Medicine and author of No-Drama Discipline. Rather than immediately sending her to a chair in the corner, it\\'s important to let her know that you empathize with how she\\'s feeling. Says Dr. Siegel, \"Your child actually needs you the most when she\\'s at her worst.\" Most experts believe time-outs can be effective, as long as they are used correctly and in the right situations, especially for kids who are over age 3. \"They should be reserved for particular offenses that could cause injury to your child or someone else,\" says Parents advisor Ari Brown, M.D., a pediatrician and author of Toddler 411. ', ' 1. Using Them Too Often  Despite popular belief, time-outs aren\\'t supposed to be about getting children to think through their misdeeds. \"A time-out is primarily a \\'Let\\'s stop things from getting worse\\' strategy,\" says Eileen Kennedy-Moore, Ph.D., a Parents advisor and author of Raising Emotionally and Socially Healthy Kids. Dr. Kennedy-Moore explains, \"In the history of the universe, no children have ever gone to their rooms to \\'Think about what you did!\\' They\\'re thinking about their parents\\' meanness. The learning starts after the time-out, when you can say, \\'Okay, let\\'s try again.\\' \"  2. Giving Kids Attention During Time-Out  A time-out is essentially a mild consequence. Young kids crave attention, and even negative attention may suffice, explains Dr. Kennedy-Moore. In fact, \"time-out\" was originally short for \"time-out from positive reinforcement,\" because Dr. Staats felt that paying attention to a child\\'s misbehavior can encourage him to misbehave more. \"To me, time-out isn\\'t a naughty chair or a corner of the room,\" says Dr. Brown. \"It\\'s simply the lack of parental attention for a short period of time that lets a child see that his behavior led to losing attention instead of getting it.\"  3. Using Them for the Wrong Reason  Research from Oklahoma State University, in Stillwater, has found that time-outs work best on young children who are oppositional and defiant by hitting or intentionally doing the opposite of what you ask, but only if you first try milder responses most of the time. When a child is put in a time-out for different types of problems or if it\\'s used too often for oppositional defiance, his behavior may get worse, says study coauthor Robert E. Larzelere, Ph.D., professor of family science. Little kids who are just whining about the mashed potatoes or negotiating for more iPad time respond better to other approaches. In those types of situations, consider these tactics instead: ', ' Identify and reinforce positive opposite behaviors, such as playing gently and speaking kindly, suggests Mandi Silverman, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist in the ADHD and Behavior Disorders Center at the Child Mind Institute, in New York City. Praise or offer rewards for these behaviors, saying, \"Wow, you are playing so nicely with your toys\" or giving your child stars or stickers.  Use when-then statements. Instead of telling your child, \"We can stay at the playground for five more minutes, but only if you put your shoes back on,\" you can motivate her to cooperate by saying, \"When you put your shoes back on, then we can stay at the playground for five more minutes.\"  Strike when the iron is cold. After everyone has had a chance to cool down, you can explain, \"We don\\'t throw toys because throwing toys is dangerous.\" ', ' If you ask parents how they use time-outs, you\\'ll probably hear a wide variety of answers, ranging from having a naughty chair to keeping kids in their room. Since Dr. Staats first wrote about time-outs, researchers have changed them for the better, so they\\'re both gentler and more effective.  Step 1: Give one clear warning. The best study found that a single non-repetitive warning before every time-out can reduce the number of time-outs needed by 74 percent, says Dr. Larzelere. If your child doesn\\'t start cooperating within five seconds, proceed with the time-out.  Step 2: Announce a time-out. You might wait until your child is relatively calm, but briefly reiterate what he did wrong (\"No hitting. Time-out.\"), and escort him to a naughty chair. (Many experts advise against sending your child to his room because he\\'ll have toys, books, and other fun things there.) Resist the urge to lecture him. It\\'s okay to offer an explanation before the time-out or after it, but not during it. If you say things like, \"I\\'ve told you about this a thousand times,\" \"Now you are paying the price,\" or \"I hope you are thinking about what you did,\" you are giving your child attention rather than removing it—and any attention, even negative attention, can act as a reward rather than a consequence.  Step 3: Start the clock. Dr. Staats originally suggested keeping kids in a time-out until they stopped fussing, even if that took a half-hour. Today, many parents use the \"one minute for every year of a child\\'s age\" rule. However, recent research done by Timothy Vollmer, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Florida in Gainesville, shows that even brief time-outs of one to three minutes are effective, at least for children ages 3 to 5. Setting the clock for longer may make it harder to get your child to sit in a time-out in the future.  Step 4: Make it boring. During the time-out, do not talk to your child or make eye contact. Staying silent may require some practice, especially if your child says things like, \"You are the worst mom in the world!\" or asks questions like, \"Why are you doing this to me?\" and \"Can I have a glass of water?\" No matter what your child says or asks during the time-out, ignore it.  Step 5: When the timer goes off, call an end to the time-out. It doesn\\'t matter if your child is still fidgety, sassy, or crying. Once the timer goes off, the time-out is over, Dr. Vollmer says. How will you know if time-outs are working? If you start following these steps, within one to three weeks you should need to employ them less and less often. Says Dr. Larzelere, \"When you call for a time-out and mean what you say, children will learn to listen.\" ', ' Present a choice. He can cooperate or lose a privilege, such as screen time. If he chooses not to have a time-out, say, \"Okay, then it\\'s no TV,\" and walk away.  Offer time off for good behavior. You might say, \"Time-out is normally three minutes, but if you go now and sit quietly, it will be two.\"  Take it yourself. If your child is safe being unsupervised (or another adult is there), go to your own room. Or say, \"I will not talk to you for three minutes because you hit your brother.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

But when two girls visited on a recent Saturday, Bethany, 7, was uncharacteristically out of sorts. It started when she hid a headband inside her house and challenged her friends to find it. When her pals started searching close to Bethany\\'s room, her mom saw her tense up. \"Don\\'t look in those two drawers under my bed,\" Bethany anxiously ordered. \"It\\'s not in there. Nothing\\'s in there.\"  Actually, Bethany was hiding a big secret under her bed: her nighttime diapers. Bethany\\'s mom, Aileen Spencer, audibly sucks in her breath as she recalls the hide-and-seek game. \"I saw then how much the bed-wetting was upsetting her,\" says Spencer. \"It made me feel awful that at this young age, my daughter already has an embarrassing secret. Kids shouldn\\'t have to worry about secrets.\"  Nocturnal enuresis, the medical term for nighttime bed-wetting, is actually more common among school-age kids than you might think. While many children are able to hold their urine all night by age 5, up to one in eight first- and second-graders are still dealing with this embarrassing condition, says Howard Bennett, M.D., author of Waking Up Dry. The percentage drops steadily as children get older (thank goodness), but 1 in 20 10-year-olds still wets at night and an unfortunate 1 to 2 percent struggle with the problem until age 15.  For most kids, the problem is neurological. The child\\'s brain isn\\'t sending signals to his bladder to hold his urine while he\\'s sleeping. \"It reflexively empties while he\\'s asleep, just as it did when he was a baby,\" says Dr. Bennett. Genetics plays a role, too. About three out of four children who suffer have a sibling, parent, aunt, uncle\\xa0or cousin who also wet the bed during childhood. Occasionally, sudden-onset wetting can be psychological, triggered by upheaval, like a move, a new baby\\xa0or a divorce.  As many as 1 in 8 first\\xa0and second-graders still wake up wet in the night.*Families\\' names have been changed.  But despite how common bed-wetting is, even parents tend to keep the problem under the covers. Once these big kids are past what is normally the diaper stage (by around age 4), bathroom issues are no longer prime-time conversation among mom friends. For one thing, you may feel like you\\'ve flunked Parental Potty Training 101. Plus, who wants to hear others\\' criticism (\"You\\'re too easy on her! Take away those Pull-Ups!\") or naive advice (\"Just have her pee before bedtime\")? News flash: For most bed-wetters, neither of those things works.  Parents often don\\'t volunteer bed-wetting information at the pediatrician\\'s office, either. They may not want to embarrass their child or they consider it a \"home problem.\" And, unfortunately, doctors rarely ask about bed-wetting, says Dr. Bennett. \"Most docs just assume you\\'ll tell them if it\\'s a problem,\" he says. Which isn\\'t really that big of a surprise.Helping Kids Cope  Because bed-wetting is primarily neurological, punishing or shaming a child won\\'t help and can actually make the treatment process take longer. Instead, a good place to start is to simply explain to your child what\\'s happening to his body, says Lawrence Balter, Ph.D., a psychologist in New York City.  You can say something like this, suggests Balter: \"When you sleep, your brain can\\'t control your bladder. It\\'s not something you do on purpose or because you\\'re babyish. Eventually, as you get a little older, you won\\'t wet the bed.\"  Of course, knowing that bed-wetting is developmentally common or tied to a stressful experience doesn\\'t make the day-to-day reality any easier. Because of her \"problem,\" for instance, Bethany is extremely private about her hygiene. When she sleeps over at a relative\\'s house, she secretly slips on her own diaper at night. In the morning, she often wakes early to change, wash up\\xa0and throw away her diaper before anyone would notice. \"I feel like it wears on her self-esteem to know she can\\'t control her own body,\" says her mom.  The Stephenson* family of Elkton, MD, can totally sympathize. Like Bethany, Gunnar Stephenson was 7 when the pee hit the fan, so to speak. At the grocery store, Gunnar suddenly noticed that the disposable pull-up underwear he wore at night was sold in the baby aisle. \"He demanded to know if his Pull-Ups were just diapers for older kids. What could I say? He\\'s a smart kid,\" says his mother, Kathryn Stephenson. \"After that, he refused to wear them anymore, even though he was still wetting the bed.\"  Around the same time, Gunnar started getting sleepover invitations. He desperately wanted to join in the fun but couldn\\'t take the chance of soaking a sleeping bag in front of his friends. After almost two years of bedtime arguments over wet sheets, Stephenson talked to their pediatrician. The doctor referred the boy (by then, age 9) to a pediatric enuresis program at the Nemours/Alfred I. dupont Hospital for Children, in Wilmington, DE.  Major metropolitan areas usually have children\\'s facilities with urology-related programs. That\\'s a good thing. \"Most pediatricians don\\'t have the specific expertise [or the time] to tackle ongoing nocturnal enuresis,\" says Ginger Thomas, R.N., a nurse in Seattle Children\\'s Hospital\\'s pediatric urology department. Even better: Kids generally need only one appointment, with a follow-up session a few months later. So even families who don\\'t live near a children\\'s hospital sometimes make a special trip, she says. ', ' The first step is pretty simple: Doctors have patients follow basic techniques like eliminating caffeine from their diets and limiting fluids at night. Those things help, for sure, but the general consensus is that a bed alarm is the number one way to keep kids dry. An alarm usually costs $100 or less and is readily available online and at some medical-supply stores. The best ones include both an audible tone and a vibrating sensor.  How they work: your child wears a very sensitive wetness sensor in his underwear. The sensor connects to the alarm, which goes off when the child pees, waking him. Although your child has already wet the bed, over time the alarm trains his brain to wake earlier and earlier. Eventually, his brain will wake him up at the first drop so he can stop the flow; and then, before any pee escapes. This process can take up to two months, though, so it\\'s not something to try a few nights before a sleepover.  If you try the alarm, you\\'ll be pretty involved in the process; you\\'ll need to sleep in your child\\'s room or set up a baby monitor for a week or so (as Gunnar\\'s mom did) so you hear the alarm.  \"At first, I had to help wake him up and get him to the bathroom because he was so groggy,\" explains Stephenson. \"Within a couple of weeks, he was already in the bathroom by the time I got up. In four weeks, he was dry two or three nights a week—that was huge progress.\" By the eight-week mark, Gunnar wet his bed only once a week. Then?\\xa0dry, dry, dry!  Gunnar, who\\'s now 10, has been dry at night for almost a year, with no set-backs. \"We\\'re so happy for him — it takes a lot of pressure off of him and us,\" says Stephenson. Plus, Gunnar\\'s younger brother is now entering the potty-training phase. \"If he has trouble with bed-wetting, it won\\'t have to be a big embarrassing thing for him. Now we know exactly what to do.\"4 tips for pee-free nights ', ' Have your health care provider screen your child for any medical conditions—though they\\'re pretty rare—that could cause bed-wetting. Same goes for a child who has been dry at night but suddenly starts wetting; she may have a bladder infection.  Be on daytime potty patrol. Some kids pee at night because they\\'re constipated all the time; a full rectum can interfere with bladder function. In this case, offer your child plenty of water and fiber-rich foods, and talk to your doctor about an over-the-counter laxative. Also, encourage your child to try using the bathroom (even if he doesn\\'t have the urge) every two to three hours during the day. \"A bladder that is not emptied completely or often enough during the day can respond by completely letting go at night,\" explains Ginger Thomas, R.N., from Seattle Children\\'s Hospital.  Use medication sparingly. In truly extreme cases, doctors may prescribe an anti-diuretic, but it\\'s a very short-term fix. These drugs temporarily shut off the body\\'s ability to create urine, so they might prevent your child from bed-wetting at camp or a sleepover. However, as soon as your child stops the medication, he\\'ll wet again.  Make sure your child is ready.Your frustration isn\\'t the key here. Your child has to be motivated to stop wetting the bed. If he\\'s not bothered, stick with disposable nighttime undergarments for a while longer. He\\'ll let you know when it\\'s time.

Read on to learn why and to better understand how to solve their potty training problems.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  One of the most momentous times of toddlerhood for both your little and you has finally come. They've shown signs of being interested in potty training, and you are more than ready to get this ball rolling. But just like you can't force a picky eater to willingly discover new foods, you can't potty train a child who isn't ready or excited to begin the process.  Even after you both have determined now is the right time, there are inevitably potty training problems that will occur, and don't fear, they're totally normal. If you feel like this is where you're at right now, read on for common potty training problems—and their solutions. \", ' Some kids are ready to start potty training as early as 18 months, but others might be closer to 3 years old. What matters more than your toddler\\'s age is their interest in the process. \"The two big surprises are that toilet-teaching isn\\'t fast, and it isn\\'t smooth,\" says Dr. Maureen O\\'Brien, Ph.D., director of parenting and child development at The First Years in Avon, Massachusetts.  Potty training isn\\'t something you can force your child to do. What\\'s more, the older they get, the more they\\'re likely to hold bowel movements or delay urinating when they feel uncomfortable. And honestly, we all know the problems that can snowball as a result; read as–constipation and UTI.  So how do you help nudge them towards potty training without causing anxiety about going to the bathroom? First and foremost, give them time. Also, get them involved in everything about the process. From choosing their underwear to the potty chair or portable toilet seat, it gives your child a feeling of control over the process. ', \" While it can be frustrating, many children do not tell their parents when they need to use the potty. Going to the bathroom, after all, is a monumental task for young kids. Not only do they have to learn the basics of potty training (like urges and sensations), some children lack the verbiage. They cannot articulate their wants and needs. Others, for example, get distracted with new skills, tasks, and—in some cases—activities and toys.  The best thing to do to combat this is to schedule bathroom breaks. Ask your child if they feel the urge to pee. Give them verbal reminders and cues, and then tell them it's time to try. Then celebrate their attempt, even if your toddler sits on the potty but doesn't go. \", \" Being a toddler is a busy time. Play dates, spending quality time with their pal Bluey, and playing with their toys reign supreme. And sometimes, that means they aren't paying attention to the signals their body gives them. So what can you do to avoid an accident because of busyness?  Make potty time a consistent event, especially after meal times or snacks. Setting reminders and expectations about when to go helps your child connect the dots between why they start to wiggle and squirm and needing to go to the bathroom. \", \" There are many different reasons why your little one may be experiencing potty training anxiety. Maybe it's an irrational fear about being flushed down the toilet, or the flushing noise it makes is just too loud. Or perhaps they feel anxious about using a bathroom in an unfamiliar place, like anywhere but home.  As with other forms of anxiety, there is no magic wand to wave to set everything right and make apprehension disappear. Taking time to address their concerns and practicing sitting on the potty for short periods can help ease their worries and reduce apprehension. Something as simple as seeing you use the bathroom without any negative consequences will also help conquer their concern. \", \" Accidents happen—at school, on the playground, and yes, in the bathroom. And while it can be frustrating, it's important to check yourself and your reaction, i.e. you should never punish your child for bathroom-related mistakes.  Of course, the reason is two-fold: Punishing your child for an accident will impact their confidence. They are already embarrassed, after all. This will negatively color their experience and make them less likely to try. It also can (and usually does) result in more accidents. So what can you do? How should your react?  When your child has an accident, respond with patience and encourage them to keep trying. For example, if they had an accident because they didn't go to the bathroom before leaving the house, talk about what they can do (like always going before leaving the house) to avoid another accident in the future. Positive reinforcement is key. \", \" Things have been going great! There hasn't been an accident in a week, and you are super thrilled that this whole potty training thing is in the past. Then, it happens; suddenly, it feels like you are back to square one.  One of the most frustrating experiences during potty training is when your child regresses. Maybe you went from dry underwear all the time to putting a pull-up back on at night. Or maybe, before they had mastered number one and two, but now they ask for a diaper to do their business.  Whatever area has regressed, take comfort in the fact that this happens often. Sometimes it involves a new change like starting school, having a new sibling, or other big changes to their routine. Talk to your child and listen to what's going on. Listen to them explain in their own words how they're feeling or what is new to get a better idea of how to reassure and support them to continue making progress in their potty training.

More than half are as smart or smarter than their peers, but some may struggle with social skills or behavior all their lives.  Read on for what you need to know about ASD. And here’s what you need to remember: Like their peers, kids with ASD are growing and learning, and they have unknown potential.

Autism by the Numbers:  Tips for Family Friends:  Atlanta’s Nationally-Recognized Center for Autism  Therapies, Treatments and Interventions:  For More Information: ', ' Don’t make assumptions. Just because a child is non-verbal doesn’t mean they can’t\\xa0 understand what is being said to them or about them.  Telling the parent of a high-functioning autistic child that they don’t look “disabled” is hurtful and insulting.  No two children with ASD are exactly alike; each has different needs, abilities, disabilities and characteristics.  Autistic children are so much more than their diagnosis – they are amazing and talented.  The daily struggles of a child with ASD are sometimes great, but it makes the successes they achieve that much sweeter.  A little support goes a long way. Don’t feel pity; help if you can, empathize if possible, but always show respect and dignity.  Parenting is difficult already – having a child with autism adds to it. An empathetic smile or a nod during a tantrum in a public place is more helpful than a disapproving frown.  Children with autism may seem socially distant, but most desire to have friendships but need help developing the social and communication skills to successfully interact with peers.  If you see a child older than two or three screeching instead of talking, there is a good chance that child has autism and is not just being “bad” or “acting out.”  Parents of children with ASD learn to see the world in a unique and beautiful way that those not walking the same path may not be able to comprehend. ', ' The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened at least twice before the age of 24 months. Research has shown children with autism do better with early diagnosis and therapy. ', ' Children with autism can make great gains throughout life. Know the following “red flags” by age:  By 6 months:\\xa0Few or no big smiles or engaging expressions Limited or no eye contact  By 9 months: Little or no back-and-forth sharing of sounds, smiles or other facial expressions  By 12 months: Little or no babbling, back-and-forth gestures such as pointing, showing, reaching or waving; little or no response to name  By 16 months:\\xa0Very few or no words  By 24 months: Very few or no meaningful, two-word phrases (not including imitating or repeating ', ' A child with ASD might have these symptoms, though a typical child also could display some of these symptoms:  Doesn’t respond to their name by 12 months of age  Doesn’t point at objects to show interest (point at an airplane flying over) by 14 months  Doesn’t play “pretend” games (pretend to “feed” a doll) by 18 months  Avoids eye contact and wants to be alone  Has trouble understanding other people’s feelings or talking about his own feelings  Has delayed speech and language skills  Repeats words or phrases over and over  Gives unrelated answers to questions  Gets upset by minor changes  Has obsessive interests  Flaps his hands or arms, rocks his body, or spins in circles  Has unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look or feel ', ' 1 in 36: The estimated number of children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, according to the CDC. In 1975, an estimated 1 in 1,500 were diagnosed with an ASD.  4: The number of times boys are more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls.  2-18: The percent chance that parents who have a child with ASD have of having a second child who is also affected.  44: The percentage of children with autism who have IQ scores in the average to above average range.  40: the estimated percentage of people with autism who are nonverbal.  $60,000: The amount, on average, autism costs parents or caregivers annually. ', ' To get to know a child with autism, adults and kids could try some of these strategies:  Keep conversations focused and simple. They are literal thinkers – they will go to the window to see cats and dogs if you say, “It’s raining cats and dogs.”  Talk about what the kid wants to talk about. Some might be obsessed with certain subjects, like superheroes or trains.  Be patient. Kids with ASD often take longer to process information.  Stay positive. They respond to positive reinforcement; ignore acting-out behavior.  Play with the child or encourage your kids to play. Sometimes they communicate better and feel calmer when they’re moving or focused on a toy.  Be affectionate. Kids may not be able to express appreciation, but most of them love hugs.  Believe in them. Kids with autism are growing children with an unknown potential; don’t define the kid by the diagnosis. ', ' Marcus Autism Center, one of the largest autism centers in the United States, has been serving children and adolescents with autism and related disorders since 1991. It is one of only five National Institute of Health (NIH) Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE). The ACE designation supports research to identify causes and best treatments of autism. In conjunction with Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, the center treats more than 5,500 children each year, and offers services such as assessment and diagnosis, medical services, severe behavior therapy and a language and learning program.  Children will be assessed and diagnosed at the center in two groups: Ages 2 and younger will be tested using the one-day toddler evaluation and ages 3 and older will have a two-day appointment. These involve developmental testing, assessment of social interaction, communication and other objectives. Parents will receive a full report of the findings so they can choose the next step for treatment.  Research is an important part of what Marcus Autism Center does, and it seeks participants for its ongoing studies. The center is now enrolling participants in several studies for expectant mothers and newborns, toddlers and school-age children. ', ' As ASD affects each person differently, treatment plans often involve multiple professionals and include different therapies to cater to the individual.  Applied Behavior Analysis: Training methods that encourage desired behaviors and discourages undesired behaviors to improve a variety of skills.  Speech and Language Therapy: Improves the person’s understanding and use of speech and language, either through verbal communication or the use of signs, gestures, pictures or electronic communication.  Occupational Therapy: Teaches skills that help the person live independently.  Sensory Integration Therapy: Improves responses to sensory input that may be restrictive or overwhelming.  Social-Relational Treatments: Focus on improving social skills and building emotional bonds.  Cognitive-Behavior Therapy: Helps children with ASD cope with anxiety, depression and other mental health issues: it focuses on learning the connections between thoughts, feelings and behaviors.  Floortime: A relationship-based therapy for children where adults play and interact with the child at their level.  Relationship Development Intervention: A family-based, behavioral treatment focused on building social and emotional skills.  Joint Attention Therapy: Improves specific skills related to shared attention, such as pointing, showing or coordinating looks between a child and an object.

RELATED: The Best Hiking Backpack Carriers for Babies, Toddlers, and Their Grownups  How do you know when it’s time to potty train? Your kid may be showing signs they’re ready when they tug at dirty diapers, hide to poop, express interest in you using the toilet, and have enough verbal skills to let you know when they need to go. This time frame is different for every kid, but if you suspect your child is ready to take on potty training and you’re interested in the three-day potty training method, read on. \", \" Potty-Training Book for Adults: 3 Day Potty Training  Potty-Training Book for Kids: P Is for Potty!

You won’t be cooking, cleaning or visiting with friends—or keeping up with the Kardashians.”  And when you’re figuring out how to potty train, she says, you must plan ahead: “Have your shopping done and meals prepared ahead of time. Do the laundry and clean the house prior to starting. Be ready to play games, color, watch cartoons and just enjoy some bonding time with your child.”  It’s not a bad idea to arrange playdates out of the home for older kids, too. Make this three-day potty-training mission about your soon-to-be potty pro.  Pick up a few T-shirts that will cover your kid’s private area. Why? Your child will be going commando for three days. The theory is that if they know the diaper isn’t there to catch the pee or poop, it should click that they need to get their bare butt to a potty.  “We do not put pants on the child during the training process because we want to be able to see when they have an accident,” she says.  Stock up on drinks, too, because you’re going to encourage your kid to drink more than usual. This will obviously cause your kid to have to pee, and that’s what you want when potty training as they learn to recognize that feeling.  Hit up the local dollar store for potty- training incentives—stickers, crayons, coloring books and action heroes. Stay strong and remember prizes are for peeing in the toilet, not on the rug or all over themselves. ', ' “Accidents will happen; that is part of training. Children learn from having those accidents,” says Jensen of potty training girls and boys. “The 3-Day Potty Training Method is against punishments during training. You will clean up the accident and simply encourage them to make it to the toilet next time. Praise goes a long way.” ', ' If your kid doesn’t go after sucking down a juice box, remind them to go. And when they say “no”—and they will!—tell them just to try. Remember, this is potty training, not game day. You’re the coach. ', ' When your child wakes up in the morning, take off their soggy diaper and bid it farewell. Have your kid throw the diaper out and say “bye-bye.”  Dress them in an oversized T-shirt and/or big kid underwear and explain there is no diaper to catch the pee-pee or poop, so they have to put it in the potty.  Give your kid breakfast and an extra drink. Afterwards, lead your little one to the potty. It should be a successful trip after all those liquids.  Go on with the day, but remember, no leaving the house during the three-day potty training. Play, read, color, and watch cartoons.  Have a sippy cup of water in your kid’s reach at all times. Just like crate-training a puppy, walk your child to the potty every 15 minutes, all day long, for three days.  Cut off all liquids and snacks after dinner while potty training.  Complete one final potty mission before bed.  Wake your kid up halfway through the night to pee. (Yes, set an alarm.)  Repeat for the next two days.  Don’t get upset about potty-training accidents.

Training for both at the same time keeps the child from getting confused…If you train for both day and night, you eliminate the crutch or feeling they can just go in their diaper or pull-up,” Jensen says of potty training.

By          Agatha Achindu          March 12, 2019 \", \" Why your toddler has become picky  Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when expanding your child's palate.  For the first 18 months to two years of your child’s life, you’ve diligently fed your child by either breast, bottle or spoon with everything being eaten quite agreeably. Then, suddenly, your toddler begins to refuse food. Of course, you worry. “Why won’t my child eat? Have I done something wrong?” As a mother of three and a certified Integrative Nutrition Coach and the founder of Yummy Spoonfuls, I’m well aware of the challenges of picky eating.  Understanding that we all are quite literally what we eat, my two-sided approach to overcoming this particular toddler issue will help you provide your little one with the proper nutrition they need to fully thrive. \", ' If you have a picky toddler, you are not alone. The reasons for this sudden food aversion are both simple and complex:  They’re becoming more independent. Now that your child has started walking and is beginning to speak, they are developing a sense of independence and have the consciousness to act upon it. Whether your child likes a particular food or not, they can refuse to open their mouth, run away, cry in protest, throw a tantrum or do all of the above.  They’re becoming more intuitive. Toddlers can begin to notice a pattern with eating: most “good” foods are sweet and most unsweet foods are green. The vast majority of baby food products combine vegetables with sweet foods like apples, bananas or pears. A baby who has grown accustomed to eating such products develops a palate for sweet foods. When attempting to introduce a non-sweet green vegetable, that toddler will inevitably notice the difference and refuse it. Parents also tend to impose their own food hang-ups on children. For example, parents who do not like okra or brown rice do not cook those foods for themselves and therefore do not give them to their children. It’s important for parents to remember that eating is a learned behavior beginning with the very first spoonful and reinforced with each and every meal.  They’re learning what they do and don’t like. Your child may not be a fan of certain textures. Because eating is as much about tactile sensation as it is about taste, your child may not like foods that are too crunchy, slimy, soft, grainy, chewy and so on. If this is the case then your child’s pickiness should be consistent across different flavors. For example, if they don’t like crunchy foods, they’ll refuse a sweet, juicy crisp green apple as quickly as they’d turn down fresh, crisp celery. The problem is not the pickiness but rather the way that pickiness is managed. ', ' 1. Don’t stop trying to introduce new foods too soon.  Many parents aren’t aware of the lengthy yet normal course of food acceptance in children. A 2004 study published in the Journal of the American Diet Association revealed that 25% of mothers with toddlers offered foods only once or twice before deciding if the child liked it. Approximately half of mothers made similar judgments after serving new foods only three to five times.  Touching, smelling, playing with and spitting out food are all normal exploratory behaviors that happen before acceptance—and some kids simply take longer to try new food and develop a taste or affinity for it. Keep trying and eventually, your child will come around. Be consistent, don’t give up and remember, this stage in your child’s life is critical as the foods they eat now are key building blocks for healthy growth and development.  2. Bring home the food items you want your child to eat.  Your child can only be as picky as the food options that are made available to them. If you want them to eat more healthful foods, fill your refrigerator and pantry with what you believe are healthy, nutritious food options. You can also make life easy for yourself by stocking your freezer with convenient foods that don’t skimp on taste and nutrition.  3. Expose kids to all varieties of foods.  Introduce your child to an array of food flavors and textures no matter what your own personal preferences or aversions may be. Your child may very well love some of the foods you dislike.  4. Don’t provide too many food options.  Often parents of multiple children will make a variety of dishes for a meal in order to appease each child’s individual tastes. This kind of short-order cooking habit is tiring, unsustainable and only serves to foster the habit you are trying to correct. There’s no reason for any child to stop being picky if other options are always readily available. Unless your child has an allergy or sensory issue, then they should learn to try whatever you serve.  5. Don’t supplement missed meals with junk.  Every parent living with a toddler understands the practice of “picking one’s battles” but setting up healthy nutrition practices is a battle that should be fought to win. If your child refuses to eat a meal because they don’t like the options available, try not to give your child junk food just to fill their belly. In time, those empty calories can become lifelong unhealthy choices. Your child depends on you to choose a balanced diet that is developmentally appropriate and fuels good health and happiness.  6. Treat every meal and snack time as an opportunity to nourish your child with good food.  Instead of viewing snack time as “treat” time, consider snack time a mini meal and feed your child accordingly. Again, give your child every opportunity to get acquainted with new foods. Avoid crackers and other convenience foods and try giving your child sliced carrots or bell peppers instead.  7. Make every eating experience enjoyable.  As many studies have shown, children who help with meal preparation are more likely to eat food they helped make, so let your child pitch in! Make cooking each meal a family activity by allowing your child to help. This is a great way to show your child that delicious food and healthy food aren’t mutually exclusive. Prepare foods in their most delicious and visually-appealing form and be sure to take into account your child’s texture preferences. For example, don’t overcook string beans for a child who likes their veggies firm.  8. Don’t force a “clean plate.”  While you may be anxious about your child getting the necessary nutrients they need for growth and development, avoid forcing them to eat every bite you serve. Your child is not trying to frustrate you, they’re simply learning as everything is still new and different to them.  Remember that for many kids, food acceptance takes time and this important stage in your toddler’s life is absolutely normal. Also, forcing them to clean their plate causes a child to lose their natural sense of knowing when they are full, which can lead to overeating. Building healthy eating habits means respecting when your child is full even when you may think they’ve not had enough. After all, you can always serve any leftovers as a mini meal for snack time.

Serve finger foods and dips  By          Sara Vance          July 30, 2018 ', ' Here are five strategies for guiding your toddler past the picky eating stage and get them the nutrients they need.  Toddlers are a busy, active, and very curious bunch so it should come as no surprise that getting them to sit still for a meal may be a challenge. Because growth tends to slow down a bit in the toddler years, they may be slightly less hungry at this age, too, so it’s no wonder that toddlers can turn into picky eaters at this time.  First, don’t worry if you have a picky little one. It’s common at this stage, and most toddlers will grow out of it. However, picky kids can grow into picky adults if they don’t expand their palate beyond “kid foods.” ', ' One of my favorite ways to sneak a lot of nutrient dense foods into kids is with smoothies! If you have a good recipe, you can easily add in veggies and superfoods to boost the nutrition without sacrificing taste. Adding baby spinach to a smoothie is kind of like a “secret salad” because they get the nutrition of the salad greens, without knowing they are eating them!  Vegetables not only add vitamins and minerals but can add beautiful color making it more appealing to littles. Try a fiber and nutrient-rich smoothie. Plus, smoothies are portable so a busy toddler (and mama) can take them on the go. ', ' When there is a picky eater at the table, mealtime can turn into a power struggle, which can not only make meals a chore, but it can actually foster picky eating habits. Ditch the power struggles for fun and just see what happens!  Cut fruits and veggies into shapes, have carrot crunching contests at the table, serve food with mini kid-sized utensils and colorful bowls. Do what you can to make eating fun for your toddler, even if it’s telling jokes or singing songs at the table. When meal and snack time are joyful, it helps develop healthier attitudes and relationships with food. ', ' Consider offering foods that they can pick up with their fingers and add in healthy dips. Pro tip: most toddlers love to dip finger foods. Veggies are great dipped in hummus or a healthier ranch dip. Chicken strips are extra yummy dipped in a simple homemade honey mustard sauce (simply combine mustard, honey, mayo and a pinch of salt to taste).  Your toddler might enjoy dessert hummus, which is made from chickpeas and flavored with cinnamon, cocoa or vanilla. It’s loaded with all the protein and fiber of regular hummus, but it tastes like cookie dough or frosting, making it a nutritional treat. Dip into it with apple slices or an organic whole grain cookie. ', ' You might be surprised at how much a toddler can actually do in the kitchen. I have taught cooking lessons to kids as young as 3 years old, and they always amaze me with their abilities! When a kid makes something on their own, they will be way more willing to try it. Get your toddler into the kitchen to help make simple recipes, like sandwich wraps, yogurt parfaits, and smoothies and see how it changes their willingness to try new foods. ', ' A new study conducted by the CDC found that  babies and toddlers are getting way too much added sugar  . High sugar intake in toddlers and babies could be influencing their food preferences, and setting them up for future bad eating habits, the research explains. Sugar is not just empty calories, eating high sugar diets can also increase the risk of weight gain and even increase the risk of disease later in life.  Sweet foods and sugary drinks can cause blood sugar to spike then crash, which can contribute to toddler meltdowns. To choose foods that will provide lasting energy for your toddler, I recommend avoiding sweetened drinks and following my “Rule of Three” for eating: make sure that each meal or snack contains at least one of the following blood-sugar leveling macronutrients:  Healthy fats (found in nuts, seeds, avocado, and full-fat organic dairy products like cheese and yogurt)  Fiber (sources include whole fruit and veggies, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds  Protein (Good animal-based sources include meat, dairy and eggs, while good plant-based sources include nuts, seeds, legumes, hemp, chia and quinoa).  Naturally sweet whole fruits come paired with vitamins, minerals and fiber, making them a better choice for toddlers than a sugary snack or drink that is just empty calories.  As a former picky eater myself, and the mom of a reformed picky eater, I know the struggle is real when it comes to picky eating, and that there is no “quick fix.” Just take it one day at a time, keep encouraging them, and avoid the power struggles! If you don’t see improvement in your child’s eating habits, consider scheduling a consultation with the pediatrician or a feeding specialist.

By          Christine Organ          May 27, 2022  @Lazy_Bear/Twenty20  I didn’t realize how strange this was until I was recently talking with some friends. Most mothers I know, at some point, have slept with their children. I seem to be in the minority of moms because I never had my kids sleep in my bed.  When my oldest son was born, he slept in a crib or pack-n-play from day one. Same with my youngest son. When they were toddlers and awoke in the middle of the night (which, admittedly, was rare), I hugged them and tucked them back into their own beds.  Related: We need to stop shaming moms for co-sleeping—and research shows why  For some families, co-sleeping is the only way for anyone to get any sleep. And for many parents, co-sleeping is an enjoyable bonding experience. Not for me. And part of my motherhood journey has meant honoring my own boundaries—one of which is nighttime is for me.  Not everyone shares this disdain for co-sleeping—my husband included. In fact, when our kids were younger, anytime I went out of town, he and our kids would have a slumber party in our bedroom. They’d sleep cuddled up in our queen bed, arms intertwined and snoring away. When my husband went out of town, however, I fiercely protected my bed.  Some might call this selfish; I call it setting healthy boundaries for myself. I knew that I needed sleep to be an engaged mother the next day. I knew that I needed those precious few hours of “alone time” to recharge. And in those early days of motherhood when I was constantly touched out, I needed the physical space.  Just because we are mothers doesn’t mean we can’t have boundaries, especially when those boundaries help us be the good moms that we want to be, the good moms that we know we are.  Quite simply, setting this motherhood boundary made me a better mom.  I didn’t really think much of it, but over time, I’ve realized just how strange it is that I have never co-slept with my kids. When I heard about moms who loved snuggling up with their toddlers, I wondered if something was wrong with me. When I read about the benefits of laying down with our kids until they fall asleep, I worried that I wasn’t being a “good mom” because I set this limit.  Whatever your boundary is, accept it. Acknowledge it. Stop apologizing for it.  Over time, I’ve realized that this was just that pesky mom guilt sneaking in again. Oh, how mom guilt loves to make us fret, doesn’t it? With time and age—not to mention the fact that my kids are incredible sleepers—I stopped fretting and worrying. Just because we are mothers doesn’t mean we can’t have boundaries, especially when those boundaries help us be the good moms that we want to be, the good moms that we know we are.  It was never really about sleeping with my kids; it was about boundaries and telling that pesky mom guilt to take a hike. Because it will always be something, right?  Whatever your boundary is, accept it. Acknowledge it. Stop apologizing for it.  Maybe you love snuggling up with your child at night. If so, go for it. Maybe you have an early bedtime or you have a playdate limit or you say “no” to weekend activities so you can decompress with your family. Whatever your boundaries are, respect them. Own them. Be empowered by them, not ashamed of them. Because you are doing what it takes to be the best mom you can be.  Related: Why I Share a Bed With My Baby  So whatever your mom boundary is, shed the mom guilt about it. We are mothers, not martyrs. And we should feel empowered by, not guilty about, setting boundaries that help us be the best mothers we can be. When we set these boundaries, we aren’t just taking care of ourselves, we are teaching our children valuable lessons about boundaries, body autonomy and healthy relationships.  We are showing them that their wants don’t take precedence over others’ needs. And we are showing them that it is possible to love them with all of our hearts while also respecting ourselves. And in doing so, we are showing them how to love and respect themselves too.

In a study published in The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)’s journal “Pediatrics,” researchers tracked the sleep patterns of 221 soon-to-be kindergartners with an eye toward how much sleep they got in a 24-hour period, and whether that sleep was consolidated overnight or combined from naps and nighttime sleep.  They found that the kids who consistently slept for at least 10 hours at night—not including naps—were better able to adjust to kindergarten, and their teachers reported they had better socio-emotional, learning engagement and academic outcomes than those kids who had more irregular sleep patterns.  Related: Our son thanked us for ‘redshirting’ him in kindergarten  In the study, the teachers were blind to how much sleep each child was getting, and the researchers controlled for income-to-poverty threshold ratios, child health status and number of missed school days.  “The transition to kindergarten requires new social, emotional, and cognitive competencies, significant expansion of children’s social networks, and formal instruction and evaluation never experienced before,” write the study authors. They noticed that while factors like children’s health and their socioeconomic status have been examined in terms of kindergarten transition success, sleep duration has not. ', ' As a society, we tend to overlook the value of sleep—but according to sleep expert and neuroscientist Dr. Matthew Walker, it’s incredibly important for brain health. “Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day,” he writes in his book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams. “When sleep is abundant, minds flourish. When it is deficient, they don’t.”  In kids, sleep can improve focus and concentration, as well as memory, mood, immune function, school performance and behavior, notes AAP.  Related: California becomes first state to delay school start times—here’s why that matters  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and National Sleep Foundation recommend 5-year-olds get 10 to 13 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period, but the Pediatrics study shows that at least 10 hours of consolidated nighttime sleep seems to be the magic number in terms of kindergarten success. ', ' The more regularly a child slept for at least 10 hours at night, the better the child was able to adjust to kindergarten, note the authors. Their kindergarten success was even more pronounced if the 10 hours of nightly sleep was established before kindergarten began, when the child was still in preschool.  “The more consistently children got 10+ hours of sleep during the night, the better the children’s peer relationships, relationships with their teachers, overall academic performance, and sight recognition of words and letters,” says lead study author Douglas Teti, distinguished professor and head of the department of human development and family studies at The Pennsylvania State University,  to CNN.  Related: Why I got strict about a 7 p.m. bedtime for my kids ', ' You may want to start sooner than later if your little one is starting kindergarten in the fall, given that it was long-term sleep habits that seemed to make the most impact.  “The intervention should begin before kindergarten begins in September,” Teti says. “Parents should do what they can to help their children get most if not all of their sleep on a regular basis during the children’s nighttime sleep period.”  That may mean cutting back on naps to help consolidate your child’s sleep at night. Naps may still be developmentally appropriate for your kiddo, but if it means their bedtime is pushed back till later, it could be worth omitting the nap. If you have questions or concerns, your child’s pediatrician is a good resource. ', ' For early school-age kids, the authors recommend bedtime before 9 p.m., which would make wake-up time around 7 a.m., for a full 10 hours of nighttime sleep. Naps should count as extra, not toward that 10-hour goal.  Kids should avoid all screens like TVs, tablets and phones at least 30 minutes before bedtime.  Parents and caregivers should be involved in their child’s bedtime routines, keeping them as consistent as possible night after night. That may look like a bath after dinner, followed by books before tucking in.  Because parents’ and kids’ sleep schedules tend to be closely aligned, parental sleep habits are also important to monitor, note the authors. That may mean starting a more consistent bedtime routine for yourself, too.  “Good sleep hygiene [e.g., organized bedtime routines, limited screen access, and bedtimes before 9 p.m.] may be as critical for the well-being of children as it is for adults,” note the authors.

Any big change in routine can have ripple effects on bedtime—but starting back at school is especially fraught, as the onset of homework and after-school activities can push bedtime later, while school start times require an early wakeup—meaning less zzz’s all around.  But the back-to-school period is also a good time to implement new tools and routines, like mindfulness and deep breathing, that can help kids process significant schedule changes and potential stressors and hopefully minimize the impending negative effects on their sleep.  In fact, a new study from the Stanford University School of Medicine found that elementary school-aged kids who practiced mindfulness training slept an average of 74 extra minutes a night. ', ' The research, recently published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, was focused on 115 kids in third grade and fifth grade, ages 8 to 11, with 58 children participating in a mindfulness curriculum twice a week that focused on yoga and breathwork, and 57 children participating in a standard physical education program.  Over the two-year study period, researchers used brain scans and measured the kids’ perceived social stress to get a baseline of their sleep and stress levels before, during and after the study.  What they found was impressive: Children who received the mindfulness training gained an average of 74 minutes of total sleep and 24 minutes of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep per night during the two years analyzed. Sleep duration improved within the first three months of starting the program.  In contrast, kids who participated in the physical education program experienced a decrease of 64 minutes per night of total sleep, and saw no changes in REM sleep.  “[Children who received the mindfulness curriculum] gained almost half an hour of REM sleep,” said Ruth O’Hara, PhD, a sleep expert and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford and the study’s senior author in a press release. “That’s really quite striking. There is theoretical, animal and human evidence to suggest it’s a very important phase of sleep for neuronal development and for the development of cognitive and emotional function.” ', ' Sleep issues can plague kids from all backgrounds, but the kids who participated in the study lived in low-income communities with high rates of social stressors such as crime, violence, food insecurity and unstable housing—all significant contributing factors to poor sleep.  “To fall asleep you have to relax, but [the kids we studied] have a hard time letting their experiences go,” the study’s principal investigator, Victor Carrion, MD, the John A. Turner, MD, Endowed Professor for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry told Stanford Medicine. “They don’t feel safe and may have nightmares and fears at night.”  But twice a week for two years, yoga instructors and the kids’ school teachers taught the students what stress is, how to bring their attention to the present, deep breathing exercises and yoga-based movement.  “Children who reported higher curriculum engagement [e.g., using the breathing exercises at home] experienced larger changes in sleep architecture and perceived social stress,” reported the study authors. Thanks to having tools to employ to help them relax, the kids were able to fall asleep faster and sleep for longer. ', ' One of the unexpected results from the study was an increase in reported perceived stress—meaning that mindfulness training increased the students’ awareness of their own stress, even though it also gave them ways to reduce their vulnerability to that stress, the researchers noted.  Being more aware of their stress also helped kids better manage that stress—and they still slept better.  While plenty of studies have shown the benefits of mindfulness on stress reduction in both kids and adults, this research is unique in that it shows how stress-reduction benefits carry over to bedtime and sleep quality.  And while the study purposefully didn’t focus on sleep hygiene or bedtime routines, the mindfulness instruction empowered kids to recognize their own stress and gave them the necessary tools to manage it, with trickle-down effects on their sleeping habits. ', ' Here’s how to help your kiddos learn to recognize their stress and get more sleep—just in time for back-to-school:  Talk about what stress is with your kids and how they can recognize signs of stress.  Utilize the back-to-school period to implement new bedtime routines and set firm schedules to ensure consistency.  Help kids put a name to their feelings to better understand their emotions.  Embrace mindfulness tools like breathing exercises, yoga poses, progressive relaxation and guided meditations, especially as part of bedtime routines and during times of increased stress.

By          Deborah MacNamara          September 23, 2021 ', \" Toddlers and preschoolers crave connection, which is nature's way of keeping them close.  Accept the child's attachment hunger and provide for it generously when you can.  Don't battle their behavior nor increase separation through discipline.  Bridge the distance to reduce feelings of separation.  Play matchmaker and help the child accept their alternate caretakers.  Encourage and support tears of missing.  We’ve all been there. It’s bedtime and our littles begin stalling, “I need some water,” or, “one more story,” and sometimes, “I’m afraid,” occasionally accompanied by one big crocodile tear rolling down their precious cheek. From their lips to our hearts, these little pleas convey a much larger desire—to keep parents close, routinely disguised as a last-minute request, the last one being the most compelling in telling us why. \", ' Why is separation so difficult and why does it produce so much anxiety? Until approximately six years of age, young children are not fully developed as separate beings. They are highly dependent on others for caretaking, and staying close is one of the brain’s biggest preoccupations. In the 1950s, a British psychologist named John Bowlby coined the term attachment and said a child’s mental health was based on a satisfying and enjoyable relationship with a parent, that is both warm and continuous. Children aren’t meant to enjoy separation, it is nature’s design.  While there is nothing wrong with a young child who misses their parent, it can be unsettling to both parties.  Young children can be full of frustration, tantrums, resistance, and opposition in the face of separation. Alarm in a child often arises at nighttime, accumulated from the day and activated by the point of separation that sleep represents.  From a parent’s perspective, it can help to remember that if our children didn’t want us close, we wouldn’t be able to take care of them. Being attached is the superglue that binds us to each other and provides a sense of home, comfort, and belonging. Attachment is the doorway through which missing and separation anxiety enter.  Toddlers and preschoolers also come with shyness instincts that make them fickle when it comes to receiving care from others. This is the result of healthy brain development by six months of age, where a child zeros-in on one primary caretaker. At this time the child will begin to display stranger protest towards others and show a clear preference towards whom they want to be close. The instinct to shy away from strangers is nature’s way of ensuring they follow the people who are responsible for caring for them.  If children are meant to miss their parents and shy away from substitute caregivers, then how can we for care them given the separations that come with everyday life? ', ' Take time to collect their attention and engage with them fully. Relationships that are characterized by delight, enjoyment, and warmth tend to nourish their relational needs most of all. A deeper attachment with a child will help them grow as separate beings and allow them to face more separation. ', ' It’s important not to battle against a child’s behavior from pursuing their parent to the fears that appear at night—these are all just symptoms of the underlying separation problem. If forms of discipline are used that exacerbate the separation, such as time outs or consequences, then a child’s emotions will be more stirred up and their behavior more difficult to manage.  The focus needs to be on connection, on relationship, and on how we are holding on to them. ', ' A bridge is meant to connect two sides, despite the things that are too big to cross and in-between—like work, sleep, and school when it comes to our kids. Our focus needs to provide the antidote to separation, that is, connection.  We need to help our kids feel connected to us despite the impasse that is between us. Instead of focusing on the goodbye, we talk about the next hello, such as the plans for the following day or what you will do together when you are home from work.  At bedtime, you can focus on when you will come back and check on them, or how you will meet them in your dreams. In the day time, you can give the preschooler a picture of you to hold onto or connect with them over lunch. ', ' We can’t blame young children for preferring their parents but we can take comfort in knowing they can attach to other people too. Given their strong shyness instincts, it is important that we introduce them to the people we want to care for them.  We can’t leave these relationships up for grabs but must prime it by showing them we sanction the connection. This can include warmly introducing them to each other, pointing out similarities and common interests, and conveying that you like this person and trust them.  A child will follow those to whom they are attached, and if you demonstrate that you like the caretaker, they will follow suit with time and patience. ', ' Tears are part of the brain’s inner workings to release emotional energy when stirred up. Tears are not a problem, they are the answer when the missing is too much. What is important is to ensure a child has someone they feel comfortable with in sharing their upset, in crying or retreating to for comfort. When they can count on someone to help them emotionally, it will build trust and security with their caretaker and help them adapt to the separation from parents.  The late Maurice Sendak, author of Where the Wild Things Are, understood the problem of separation for the young child when he wrote, “And Max, the king of all wild things, was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.”  Attachment is one of the most important forces in the universe that binds us to each other.  Our kids want to be with us, and we want to maintain their love. What we can do is put our energy into making it easier to be apart from us by focusing on connection.

We can talk when you are calm.” And I walk away and let him get it all out.

As new parents quickly learn, the well-being of everyone in the household can depend on how well their baby sleeps. And when they’re older, kids who don’t get enough sleep can have trouble paying attention, mood swings, behavior problems, and leaning problems. ', \" As we sleep, our brains move between two types of sleep — non-REM and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Together, the stages of non-REM sleep and REM sleep make up a sleep cycle. Babies spend more time in REM sleep and their sleep cycles are shorter than adults. Time spent in REM sleep decreases and sleep cycles get longer as kids get older. By the time kids start school, one complete sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes, which is similar to an adult's.  Stage 1 and stage 2 non-REM sleep are light sleep stages:  A person can wake up easily.  Eye movements slow down, heart and breathing rates slow down, and body temperature decreases.  Stage 3 non-REM sleep is deep sleep:  It's harder to wake someone up. When awakened, a person often will feel groggy and confused.  Night terrors, sleepwalking, and bed-wetting can happen during this stage.  This is the most refreshing sleep stage. It’s during this stage that the body releases hormones needed for growth and development.  In the final, REM stage of the sleep cycle:  The eyes move quickly under the eyelids, breathing gets faster, and the heart beats faster. You can’t move your arms or legs during REM sleep.  This is when we have our most vivid dreams.  REM sleep is important for learning and memory. \", ' How much sleep kids need varies by age. While every child is different, experts recommend:  infants (0–3 months): 14–17 hours, including naps  infants (4–12 months: 12–16 hours, including naps  toddlers (1–2 years): 11–14 hours, including naps  preschool (3–5 years): 10–13 hours, including naps  school-age (6–13 years): 9–12 hours  teens (14–17 years): 8–10 hours ', ' A child who isn’t getting enough sleep may:  fall asleep during the day  be hyperactive (especially younger children)  have trouble paying attention  struggle with school work  be cranky, whiny, irritable, or moody  have behavior problems ', \" For kids of all ages, set up a bedtime routine that encourages good sleep habits. These tips can help kids ease into a good night's sleep:  Stick to a regular bedtime. You can give your kids a heads-up 30 minutes and then 10 minutes beforehand.  Encourage older kids and teens to set a bedtime that allows for the full hours of sleep needed at their age. A bedtime routine could include washing up and brushing teeth, reading a book, or listening to quiet music.  Turn off all screens (TV, computers, phones, tablets, and video games) at least 1 hour before bedtime. Consider removing all devices from your child’s bedroom. \", ' Learn more about sleep as your child grows:  Sleep and Your Newborn  Sleep and Your 1- to 3-Month-Old  Sleep and Your 4- to 7-Month-Old  Sleep and Your 8- to 12-Month-Old  Sleep and Your Toddler  Sleep and Your Preschooler  Sleep and Your School-Age Child  Sleep and Your Teen ', \" Parents  Kids  Teens  Sleep and Your Preschooler  Sleep and Your Newborn  Sleepwalking  Nightmares  Sleep and Your 8- to 12-Month-Old  Sleep and Your 1- to 3-Month-Old  Sleep and Your 4- to 7-Month-Old  Sleep and Your 1- to 2-Year-Old  Sleep and Your Teen  Naps  Bedwetting (Enuresis)  Night Terrors  Obstructive Sleep Apnea  Helping Your Toddler Sleep (Video)  Nightmares  Sleepwalking  What to Do if You Can't Sleep  Bedwetting  Why Do I Need to Sleep?

But if your child has ever had what's known as a night terror (or sleep terror), his or her fear was likely inconsolable, no matter what you tried.  A night terror is a sleep disruption that seems similar to a nightmare, but is far more dramatic. Though night terrors can be alarming for parents who witness them, they're not usually cause for concern or a sign of a deeper medical issue. \", \" During a night terror, a child might:  suddenly sit upright in bed  shout out or scream in distress  have faster breathing and a quicker heartbeat  be sweating  thrash around  act upset and scared  After a few minutes, or sometimes longer, the child simply calms down and returns to sleep.  Unlike nightmares, which kids often remember, kids won't have any memory of a night terror the next day because they were in deep sleep when it happened — and there are no mental images to recall. \", ' Night terrors are caused by over-arousal of the central nervous system (CNS) during sleep.  Sleep happens in several stages. We have dreams — including nightmares — during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. Night terrors happen during deep non-REM sleep. A night terror is not technically a dream, but more like a sudden reaction of fear that happens during the transition from one sleep stage to another.  Night terrors usually happen about 2 or 3 hours after a child falls asleep, when sleep moves from the deepest stage of non-REM sleep to lighter REM sleep. Usually this transition is a smooth one. But sometimes, a child becomes upset and frightened — and that fear reaction is a night terror. ', ' Night terrors have been noted in kids who are:  overtired, ill, or stressed  taking a new medicine  sleeping in a new environment or away from home  not getting enough sleep  having too much caffeine  Night terrors are relatively rare — they happen in only 3%–6% of kids, while almost every child will have a nightmare occasionally. Night terrors usually happen in kids between 4 and 12 years old, but have been reported in babies as young as 18 months. They seem to be a little more common among boys.  Some kids may inherit a tendency for night terrors — about 80% who have them have a family member who also had them or sleepwalking (a similar type of sleep disturbance).  A child might have a single night terror or several before they stop. Most of the time, night terrors simply disappear on their own as the nervous system matures. ', \" Night terrors can be very upsetting for parents, who might feel helpless when they can't comfort their child. The best way to handle a night terror is to wait it out patiently and make sure your child doesn't get hurt if thrashing around. Kids usually will settle down and return to sleep on their own in a few minutes.  It's best not to try to wake kids during a night terror. This usually doesn't work, and kids who do wake are likely to be disoriented and confused, and may take longer to settle down and go back to sleep.  There's no treatment for night terrors, but you can help prevent them. Try to:  reduce your child's stress  create a bedtime routine that's simple and relaxing  make sure your child gets enough rest  help your child from becoming overtired  don't let your child stay up too late  If your child has a night terror around the same time every night, you can try waking him or her up about 15–30 minutes before then to see if that helps prevent it.  Understanding night terrors can ease your worry — and help you get a good night's sleep yourself. But if night terrors happen repeatedly, talk to your doctor about whether a referral to a sleep specialist is needed. \", \" Parents  Kids  Teens  Nightmares  Sleepwalking  Kids and Sleep  Nightmares  What to Do if You Can't Sleep  How Can I Stop My Nightmares?

Almost every child has an occasional frightening or upsetting dream. But nightmares seem to peak during the preschool years when fear of the dark is common.  Nightmares aren't completely preventable, but parents can set the stage for a peaceful night's rest. That way, when nightmares do creep in, a little comfort from you can quickly ease your child's mind. \", \" Nightmares — like most dreams — happen during the stage of sleep when the brain is very active. The vivid images the brain is processing can seem as real as the emotions they might trigger.  This part of sleep is known as the rapid eye movement or REM stage because the eyes are rapidly moving beneath closed eyelids. Nightmares tend to happen during the second half of a night's sleep, when REM periods are longer.  When kids awaken from a nightmare, its images are still fresh and can seem real. So it's natural for them to feel afraid and upset and to call out to a parent for comfort.  By about preschool age, kids begin to understand that a nightmare is only a dream — and that what's happening isn't real and can't hurt them. But knowing that doesn't prevent them from feeling scared. Even older kids feel frightened when they awaken from a nightmare. \", \" No one knows exactly what causes nightmares. Dreams — and nightmares — seem to be one way kids process thoughts and feelings about situations they face, and to work through worries and concerns.  Some may happen when a child has stress or is dealing with a change. Events or situations that might feel unsettling — such as moving, attending a new school, the birth of a sibling, or family tensions — might also be reflected in unsettling dreams.  Sometimes nightmares are part of a child's reaction to trauma — such as a natural disaster, accident, or injury. For some kids, especially those with a good imagination, reading scary books or watching scary movies or TV shows just before bedtime can inspire nightmares.  Sometimes a nightmare has recognizable bits and pieces of the day's events and experiences, but with a scary twist. A child might not remember every detail, but can usually recall some of the images, characters, or situations, and the scary parts. \", \" Parents can't prevent nightmares, but can help kids get a good night's sleep — and that encourages sweet dreams.  To help them relax when it's time to sleep, be sure that kids:  have a regular bedtime and wake-up time  have a sleep routine that helps them slow down, and feel safe and secure as they drift off to sleep. This might include a bath, a snuggle from you, reading, or some quiet talk about the pleasant events of the day.  have a bed that's a cozy, peaceful place to quiet down. A favorite toy, stuffed animal, night-light, or dream catcher can help.  avoid scary movies, TV shows, and stories before bed — especially if they've triggered nightmares before  know that nightmares aren't real, that they're just dreams and can't hurt them \", ' Here\\'s how to help your child cope after a nightmare:  Reassure your child that you\\'re there. Your calm presence helps your child feel safe and protected after waking up feeling afraid. Knowing you\\'ll be there helps strengthen your child\\'s sense of security.  Label what\\'s happened. Let your child know that it was a nightmare and now it\\'s over. You might say something like, \"You had a bad dream, but now you\\'re awake and everything is OK.\" Reassure your child that the scary stuff in the nightmare didn\\'t happen in the real world.  Offer comfort. Show that you understand that your child feels afraid and it\\'s OK. Remind your child that everyone dreams and sometimes the dreams are scary, upsetting, and can seem very real, so it\\'s natural to feel scared by them.  Do your magic. With preschoolers and young school-age kids who have vivid imaginations, the magical powers of your love and protection can work wonders. You might be able to make the pretend monsters disappear with a dose of pretend monster spray. Go ahead and check the closet and under the bed, reassuring your child that all\\'s clear.  Mood lighting. A nightlight or a hall light can help kids feel safe in a darkened room as they get ready to go back to sleep. A bedside flashlight can be a good nightmare-chaser.  Help your child go back to sleep. Offering something comforting might help change the mood. Try any of these to aid the transition back to sleep: a favorite stuffed animal to hold, a blanket, pillow, nightlight, dreamcatcher, or soft music. Or discuss some pleasant dreams your child would like to have. And maybe seal it by giving your child a kiss to hold — in the palm of his or her hand — as you tiptoe out of the room.  Be a good listener. No need to talk more than briefly about the nightmare in the wee hours — just help your child feel calm, safe, and protected, and ready to go back to sleep. But in the morning, your child may want to tell you all about last night\\'s scary dream. By talking about it — maybe even drawing the dream or writing about it — in the daylight, many scary images lose their power. Your child might enjoy thinking up a new (more satisfying) ending to the scary dream.  For most kids, nightmares happen only now and then, are not cause for concern, and simply require a parent\\'s comfort and reassurance. Talk to your doctor if nightmares often prevent your child from getting enough sleep or if they happen along with other emotional or behavioral troubles.

It is a medical condition. A person with ADHD has differences in brain development and brain activity that affect attention, the ability to sit still, and self-control. ADHD can affect a child at school, at home, and in friendships. ', \" All kids struggle at times to pay attention, listen and follow directions, sit still, or wait their turn. But for kids with ADHD, the struggles are harder and happen more often.  Kids with ADHD can show signs in any or all these areas:  Inattentive. Kids who are inattentive (easily distracted) have trouble focusing their attention, concentrating, and staying on task. They may not listen well to directions, may miss important details, and may not finish what they start. They may daydream or dawdle too much. They may seem absent-minded or forgetful, and lose track of their things.  Hyperactive. Kids who are hyperactive are fidgety, restless, and easily bored. They may have trouble sitting still, or staying quiet when needed. They may rush through things and make careless mistakes. They may climb, jump, or roughhouse when they shouldn't. Without meaning to, they may act in ways that disrupt others.  Impulsive. Kids who are impulsive act too quickly before thinking. They often interrupt, might push or grab, and find it hard to wait. They may do things without asking for permission, take things that aren't theirs, or act in ways that are risky. They may have emotional reactions that seem too intense for the situation.  Sometimes parents and teachers notice signs of ADHD when a child is very young. But it's normal for little kids to be distracted, restless, impatient, or impulsive — these things don't always mean that a child has ADHD.  Attention, activity, and self-control develop little by little, as children grow. Kids learn these skills with help from parents and teachers. But some kids don't get much better at paying attention, settling down, listening, or waiting. When these things continue and begin to cause problems at school, home, and with friends, it may be ADHD. \", \" It's not clear what causes the brain differences of ADHD. There’s strong evidence that ADHD is mostly inherited. Many kids who have ADHD have a parent or relative with it. Kids also can be more at risk for it if they were born early, are exposed to environmental toxins, or their mothers used drugs during pregnancy.  ADHD is not caused by too much screen time, poor parenting, or eating too much sugar. \", \" If you think your child has ADHD, make an appointment with your child's doctor.\\xa0They will do a checkup, including a vision and hearing check, to be sure something else isn't causing the symptoms.  To diagnose ADHD, doctors start by asking about a child's health, behavior, and activity. They talk with parents and kids about the things they have noticed. Your doctor might ask you to complete checklists about your child's behavior, and might ask you to give your child's teacher a checklist too.  After gettng this information, doctors diagnose ADHD if it's clear that:  A child's trouble with paying attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity go beyond what's usual for their age.  The behaviors have been going on since the child was young.  The behaviors affect the child at school and at home.  A health check shows that another health or learning issue isn't causing the problems.  Many kids with ADHD also have learning problems, oppositional and defiant behaviors, or mood and anxiety problems. Doctors usually treat these along with the ADHD.  The doctor can refer you to a child psychologist or psychiatrist, if needed. \", \" Treatment for ADHD usually includes:  Medicine. This activates the brain's ability to pay attention, slow down, and use more self-control.  Behavior therapy. Therapists can help kids develop the social, emotional, and planning skills that are lagging with ADHD.  Parent coaching. Through coaching, parents learn the best ways to respond to behavior problems that are part of ADHD.  School support. Teachers can help kids with ADHD do well and enjoy school more.  The right treatment helps ADHD improve. Parents and teachers can teach younger kids to get better at managing their attention, behavior, and emotions. As they grow older, kids should learn to improve their own attention and self-control.  When ADHD is not treated, it can be hard for kids to succeed. This may lead to low self-esteem, depression, oppositional behavior, school failure, risk-taking behavior, or family conflict. \", \" If your child is diagnosed with ADHD:  Be involved. Learn all you can about ADHD. Follow the treatment your child's health care provider recommends. Go to all recommended therapy visits.  Give medicines safely. If your child is taking ADHD medicine, always give it at the recommended time and dose. Keep medicines in a safe place.  Work with your child's school. Ask teachers if your child should have an IEP\\xa0or 504 plan. Meet often with teachers to find out how your child is doing. Work together to help your child do well  Parent with purpose and warmth. Learn what parenting approaches are best for a child with ADHD\\xa0— and which can make ADHD worse. Talk openly and supportively about ADHD with your child. Focus on your child's strengths and positive qualities.  Connect with others for support and awareness. Join a support group like CHADD for ADHD to get updates on treatment and other information.

But as any parent of a toddler will tell you, they also do some not-so-adorable things, like kick, scream ... or bite.  Biting is quite common in kids this age, but it can still be rather frustrating and difficult to manage at times. Here's how to help curb this type of behavior. \", ' Biting is very common in early childhood. Babies and toddlers bite for a variety of reasons, such as teething or exploring a new toy or object with their mouth. As they begin to understand cause-and-effect, they also might bite a person to see if they can get a reaction.  Biting also can be a way for toddlers to get attention or express how they feel. Frustration, anger, and fear are strong emotions and toddlers lack the language skills to communicate how they are feeling. Instead, they may bite as a way of saying, \"Pay attention to me!\" or \"I don\\'t like that!\" Toddlers may also learn that biting can be used as a tool for accessing a desired item.  Biting is slightly more common in boys and tends to happen most often between the first and second birthday. As language improves, biting tends to lessen. ', ' Parents should have a zero-tolerance rule for biting\\xa0— at home, daycare, and elsewhere. If it does happen, be sure to deal with it right away.  The next time your child bites, try these steps:  Step 1: Be calm and firm. Address your child with a firm \"no biting!\" or \"biting hurts!\" Keep it simple and easy for a toddler to understand. Make it clear that biting is wrong, but avoid lengthy explanations until your child is old enough to understand. Remaining as calm as possible will help resolve the situation more quickly.  Step 2: Comfort the victim. Direct your attention to the person who has been bitten, especially if it\\'s another child. If there is an injury, clean the area with soap and water. Get medical care if the bite is deep or bleeding.  Step 3: Comfort the biter, if need be. Often, toddlers don\\'t realize that biting hurts. It\\'s OK to comfort a child who feels upset about hurting someone. An older toddler might learn from being allowed to comfort or apologize to a friend after a bite. But if the biter is using the behavior to get attention, you don\\'t want to reinforce this behavior by giving comfort and attention.  Step 4: Offer alternatives. When things have calmed down, suggest alternatives to biting, like using the words \"no,\" \"stop,\" and \"that\\'s mine\" when wanting to communicate with others.\\xa0For example, show your child how to approach a peer, put out their hand, and then say “please” to ask for an item.  Step 5: Redirect. Distraction works wonders with kids this age. If emotions and energy levels are running high or if boredom has set in, help redirect a little one\\'s attention to a more positive activity, like dancing to music, coloring, or playing a game.  Discipline usually is not necessary, as most kids don\\'t realize biting hurts. Never hit or bite a child who has bitten, as this teaches the child that this behavior is OK.  If you try these steps and the behavior doesn\\'t stop, time-outs may help. Older toddlers can go to a designated time-out area — a kitchen chair or bottom stair — to calm down. As a general rule, about 1 minute per year of age is a good guide for time-outs. You might need to supervise your toddler during a time-out, but be careful to not give them any attention.\\xa0Your child should be calm and quiet before leaving the time-out area.  To keep your little one on the right track:  Be consistent. Reinforce the \"No biting\" rule at all times.  Use positive reinforcement. Rather than reward negative actions with attention, make it a point to praise your child when they behave well. You can say something like, \"I like how you used your words\" or \"I like how you\\'re playing gently\" to reinforce positive alternatives to biting.  Plan ahead. Toddlers might be more comfortable and not feel the urge to bite if they know what to expect in new or high-energy situations. If biting happens at childcare, you might consider putting your child in a calmer, smaller setting.  Find alternatives. As language skills develop, you can help\\xa0your child find better ways to express difficult emotions. For example, asking kids to \"use their words\" when they\\'re frustrated or upset can help calm them. If you need help, a doctor, counselor, or behavioral specialist can discuss ways to teach your child to manage strong emotions and express feelings in a healthy way. ', \" Biting is common in babies and toddlers, but it should stop when kids are about 3 or 4 years old.

Knowing a bit about speech and language development can help parents figure out if there's cause for concern. \", \" Speech is the verbal expression of language and includes articulation (the way we form sounds and words).  Language is giving and getting information. It's understanding and being understood through communication — verbal, nonverbal, and written. \", ' Speech and language problems differ, but often overlap. For example:  A child with a language delay might say words well but only be able to put two words together.  A child with a speech delay might use words and phrases to express ideas but be hard to understand. ', \" A baby who doesn't respond to sound or vocalize should be checked by a doctor right away. But often, it's hard for parents to know if their child is taking a bit longer to reach a speech or language milestone, or if there's a problem.  Here are some things to watch for. Call your doctor if your child:  by 12 months: isn't using gestures, such as pointing or waving bye-bye  by 18 months: prefers gestures over vocalizations to communicate  by 18 months: has trouble imitating sounds  has trouble understanding simple verbal requests  by 2 years: can only imitate speech or actions and doesn't produce words or phrases spontaneously  by 2 years: says only some sounds or words repeatedly and can't use oral language to communicate more than their immediate needs  by 2 years: can't follow simple directions  by 2 years: has an unusual tone of voice (such as raspy or nasal sounding)  Also call the doctor if your child’s speech is harder to understand than expected for their age:  Parents and regular caregivers should understand about 50% of a child's speech at 2 years and 75% of it at 3 years.  By 4 years old, a child should be mostly understood, even by people who don't know the child. \", \" A speech delay might be due to:  an oral impairment, like problems with the tongue or palate (the roof of the mouth)  a short frenulum (the fold beneath the tongue), which can limit tongue movement  Many kids with speech delays have oral–motor problems. These happen when there's a problem in the areas of the brain responsible for speech. This makes it hard to coordinate the lips, tongue, and jaw to make speech sounds. These kids also might have other oral-motor problems, such as feeding problems.  Hearing problems also can affect speech. So an audiologist should test a child's hearing whenever there's a speech concern. Kids who have trouble hearing may have trouble saying, understanding, imitating, and using language.  Ear infections, especially chronic infections, can affect hearing. But as long as there is normal hearing in one ear, speech and language will develop normally. \", \" If your child might have a problem, it's important to see a speech-language pathologist (SLP) right away. You can find a speech-language pathologist on your own, or ask your health care provider to refer you to one.  The SLP (or speech therapist) will check your child's speech and language skills. The pathologist will do standardized tests and look for milestones in speech and language development.  The SLP also will check:  what your child understands (called receptive language)  what your child can say (called expressive language)  sound development and clarity of speech  your child's oral–motor status (how the mouth, tongue, palate, etc., work together for speech as well as eating and swallowing)  Based on the test results, the speech-language pathologist might recommend speech therapy for your child. \", ' The speech therapist will work with your child to improve speech and language skills, and show you what to do at home to help your child. ', ' Parents are an important part of helping kids who have a speech or language problem.  Here are a few ways to encourage speech development at home:  Focus on communication. Talk with your baby, sing, and encourage imitation of sounds and gestures.  Read to your child. Start reading when your child is a baby. Look for age-appropriate soft or board books or picture books that encourage kids to look while you name the pictures.  Use everyday situations. To build on your child\\'s speech and language, talk your way through the day. Name foods at the grocery store, explain what you\\'re doing as you cook a meal or clean a room, and point out objects around the house. Keep things simple, but avoid \"baby talk.\"  Recognizing and treating speech and language delays early on is the best approach.

Bullying can leave deep emotional scars. And in extreme situations, it can involve violent threats, property damage, or someone getting seriously hurt.  If your child is being bullied, you want to act to help stop it, if possible. You can help your child cope with teasing, bullying, or mean gossip, and lessen its lasting impact. And even if bullying isn't an issue right in your house right now, it's important to discuss it so your kids will be prepared if it does happen. \", ' Most kids get teased by a sibling or a friend at some point. And it\\'s not usually harmful when done in a playful, friendly, and mutual way, and both kids find it funny. But when teasing becomes hurtful, unkind, and constant, it crosses the line into bullying and needs to stop.  Bullying is when peers intentionally use physical, verbal, or psychological ways to torment someone else, using a real or perceived power imbalance between the bully and the victim. Bullying can range from hitting, shoving, name-calling, threats, and mocking to extorting money and possessions. Some kids bully by shunning others and spreading rumors about them. Others use social media or electronic messaging to taunt others or hurt their feelings.  It\\'s important to take bullying seriously and not just brush it off as something that kids have to \"tough out.\" The effects can be serious and affect kids\\' sense of safety and self-worth. In severe cases, bullying has contributed to tragedies, such as suicides and school shootings. ', ' Kids bully for a mix of reasons. Sometimes they pick on kids because they need a victim — someone who seems emotionally or physically weaker, or just acts or appears different in some way — to feel more important, popular, or in control. Although some bullies are bigger or stronger than their victims, that\\'s not always the case.  Sometimes kids torment others because that\\'s the way they\\'ve been treated. They may think their behavior is normal because they come from families or other settings where everyone regularly gets angry and\\xa0shouts or calls each other names. Some popular TV shows even seem to promote meanness — people are \"voted off,\" shunned, or ridiculed for their appearance or lack of talent. ', ' Unless your child tells you about bullying — or has visible bruises or injuries — it can be hard to know if it\\'s happening.  But there are some warning signs. Parents might notice kids:  acting differently or seeming anxious  not eating, not sleeping well, or not doing the things they usually enjoy  seem moodier or more easily upset than usual  avoiding certain situations (like taking the bus to school)  If you suspect bullying but your child is reluctant to open up, find ways to bring up the issue. For instance, you might see a situation on a TV show and ask, \"What do you think of this?\" or \"What do you think that person should have done?\" This might lead to questions like: \"Have you ever seen this happen?\" or \"Have you ever experienced this?\" You might want to talk about any experiences you or another family member had at that age.  Let your kids know\\xa0that if they\\'re being bullied or harassed — or see it happening to someone else — it\\'s important to talk to someone about it, whether it\\'s you, another adult (a teacher, school counselor, or family friend), or a sibling. ', ' If your child tells you about being bullied, listen calmly and offer comfort and support. Kids are often reluctant to tell adults about bullying because they feel embarrassed and ashamed that it\\'s happening, or worry that their parents will be disappointed, upset, angry, or reactive.  Sometimes kids feel like it\\'s their own fault, that if they looked or acted differently it wouldn\\'t be happening. Sometimes they\\'re scared that if the bully finds out that they told, it will get worse. Others are worried that their parents won\\'t believe them or do anything about it. Or kids worry that their parents will urge them to fight back when they\\'re scared to.  Praise your child for doing the right thing by talking to you about it. Remind your child that they\\'re not alone — a lot of people get bullied at some point. Explain that it\\'s the bully who is behaving badly — not your child. Reassure them that you will figure out what to do about it together.  In surveys, most kids and teens say that bullying happens at school. Let someone at school (the principal, school nurse, or a counselor or teacher) know about the situation. Often they can watch and take steps to prevent further problems.  \"Bullying\" can describe a wide range of situations, so there\\'s no one-size-fits all approach. What works in one situation may not in another. Many things — such as the age of the kids involved, the severity of the situation, and the specific type of bullying behaviors — will help determine the best course of action.  Take it seriously if you hear that the bullying will get worse if the bully finds out that your child told or if threats of physical harm are involved. Sometimes it\\'s useful to approach the bully\\'s parents. But in most cases, teachers or counselors are the best ones to contact first. If you\\'ve tried those methods and still want to speak to the bullying child\\'s parents, it\\'s best to do so where a school official, such as a counselor, can mediate.  Most schools have bullying policies and anti-bullying programs. Also, many states have bullying laws and policies. Find out about the laws in your community. In some cases, if you have serious concerns about your child\\'s safety, you may need to contact legal authorities. ', ' Parents can help kids learn how to deal with bullying if it happens. For some parents or caregivers, it may be tempting to tell a kid to fight back. After all, you\\'re angry that your child is suffering and maybe you were told to \"stand up for yourself\" when you were young. Or you may worry that your child will continue to be bullied, and think that fighting back is the only way to put a bully in their place.  But it\\'s important to advise kids not to respond to bullying by fighting or bullying back. It can quickly escalate into violence, trouble, and someone getting injured. Instead, it\\'s best to walk away from the situation, hang out with others, and tell an adult.  Here are some other ways kids can improve the situation and feel better:  Tell an adult.\\xa0Teachers, principals, parents, and lunchroom personnel at school can all help stop bullying.  Avoid the bully and use the buddy system. Use a different bathroom if a bully is nearby and don\\'t go to your locker if nobody else is around. Make sure you have someone with you so that you\\'re not alone with the bully. Buddy up with a friend on the bus, in the hallways, or at recess — wherever the bully is. Offer to do the same for a friend.  Hold the anger. It\\'s natural to get upset by the bully, but that\\'s what bullies thrive on. It makes them feel more powerful. Practice not reacting by crying or looking red or upset. It takes a lot of practice, but it\\'s a useful skill for keeping off of a bully\\'s radar. Sometimes kids find it useful to practice \"cool down\" strategies such as counting to 10, writing down their angry words, taking deep breaths, or walking away. Sometimes the best thing to do is to teach kids to keep their face calm until they are clear of any danger (smiling or laughing may provoke the bully).  Act brave, walk away, and ignore the bully. Firmly and clearly tell the bully to stop, then walk away. Practice ways to ignore the hurtful remarks, like acting uninterested or texting someone on your cellphone. By ignoring the bully, you\\'re showing that you don\\'t care. Eventually, the bully will probably get bored with trying to bother you.  Talk about it. Talk to someone you trust, such as a guidance counselor, teacher, sibling, or friend. They may offer some helpful suggestions. Even if they can\\'t fix the situation, it may help you feel a little less alone. ', \" Dealing with bullying can hurt a child's confidence. To help rebuild it, encourage your kids to spend time with friends who have a positive influence. Participation in clubs, sports, or other enjoyable activities builds strength and friendships.  Provide a listening ear about tough situations, but encourage your kids to also tell you about the good parts of their day, and listen attentively so that open communication becomes a habit for everyone. Make sure they know you believe in them and that you'll do what you can to address any bullying. \", \" Parents  Kids  Teens  Cyberbullying  Teaching Kids Not to Bully  Helping Kids Cope With Cliques  Dealing With Bullies  How to Handle Peer Pressure  How Cliques Make Kids Feel Left Out  School Violence: What Students Can Do  Cyberbullying  Sexual Harassment and Sexual Bullying  Coping With Cliques  Dealing With Bullying  Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Pinterest  About Us  Contact Us  Partners  Editorial Policy  Permissions Guidelines  Privacy Policy & Terms of Use  Notice of Nondiscrimination  Note: All information on Nemours KidsHealth is for educational purposes only.

It also causes the urge to do behaviors called compulsions (also called rituals). Kids and teens with OCD get stuck in a stressful cycle of these thoughts, anxiety, and rituals.  If you think your child has OCD, start with a visit to your child's doctor or mental health provider. They can check for OCD or for other problems that could be the cause of your child's symptoms. \", ' Treatment for OCD is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In therapy, kids learn coping and calming skills for anxiety. They learn how to safely face fears without doing rituals.  Along with therapy, doctors may give medicines for OCD to some kids. For kids who need medicines, doctors give SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). These include Zoloft®, Prozac®, and Luvox®.  Treatment works best when a parent or caregiver goes to therapy with their child. That way, they can learn how to coach their child through OCD symptoms, help their child practice skills they learn in therapy, and offer daily support. ', ' These are stressful thoughts that come to mind over and over. A child with OCD doesn\\'t want to think about these things. But they feel they can\\'t stop.  Parents may notice obsessions as intense fears or worries. Kids with OCD may feel unusually upset about:  germs, dirt, illness, injury, or harm  whether someone could get sick, hurt, or die  things that seem wrong, or out of place  whether bad thoughts might come true  things that are not straight, even, or arranged \"just right\" ', ' These are behaviors a child will do, trying to feel better. To the child, rituals seem like the way to stop thoughts and relieve fears. They seem like a way to keep bad things from happening.  Parents may notice that kids:  touch, tap, or step in unusual ways  arrange things over and over  repeat words, phrases, or questions  have many doubts, and trouble making choices  wash or clean more than needed  take a long time to do things — like get dressed, shower, eat, do homework  Kids may involve parents in rituals. And at first, parents may not realize that something is a ritual. For example, a child with OCD might ask for reassurance over and over. Or a child may insist a parent say or do something a set number of times, or in a set way.  Kids and teens with OCD can have obsessions, compulsions, or both. ', \" OCD symptoms are hard on kids. Rituals may seem to give them some relief at first. But rituals multiply. They start to take more time and energy. Kids have little left for things they enjoy. OCD thoughts, feelings, and rituals become a stressful cycle. This can make it hard to focus in school, have fun with friends, get to sleep, or relax.  Kids may seem:  anxious, worried  frustrated, irritable  sad, tired  upset when they can't do a ritual  to need constant reassurance from a parent that things are OK  Some kids may not let parents know about the thoughts, fears, and behaviors OCD causes. They may feel confused or ashamed about their fear and keep it to themselves. They may try to hide rituals they do. Some kids may have OCD symptoms for a while before their parents realize it. \", ' If you think your child may have OCD:  Talk with your child about what you\\'ve noticed. Talk in a supportive way, listen, and show love. Say something that works for your child\\'s situation like, \"I notice you fixing your socks a lot, trying to get them even. Getting them to feel right causes you a lot of stress.\"  Say that something called OCD might be causing the worry and the fixing. Tell your child that a checkup with a doctor can find out if this is what\\'s going on. Let your child know that this can get better, and that you want to help.  Make an appointment with a child psychiatrist or psychologist. Your child\\'s doctor can help you find the right person. To diagnose OCD, they will spend time talking with you and your child. They will ask questions about your child\\'s symptoms that help point them to signs of OCD. If they diagnose OCD, they can explain the treatment.  Take part in your child\\'s therapy. Part of treatment is coaching parents on how to respond to their child\\'s OCD symptoms. Learn all you can about ways you can help. Learn how to support your child\\'s progress without giving in to rituals.  Be patient. Overcoming OCD is a process. There will be many therapy visits. Be sure to go to them all. Help your child practice the things the therapist shows you. Praise your child\\'s effort. Show how proud you feel. Remind them that OCD is not their fault.  Get support, and give it. There are lots of resources and support for families dealing with OCD. The International OCD Foundation is a good place to start. Knowing that you\\'re not alone can help you cope.

Parents might assume that kids who soil their pants are misbehaving or too lazy to use the bathroom when they have the urge to go.  But many kids beyond the age of toilet teaching (generally older than 4 years) who soil their underwear have a condition known as encopresis\\xa0(en-kah-PREE-sis). They have a problem with their bowels that dulls the normal urge to go to the bathroom. So they can't control the accidents that usually follow.  Encopresis isn't a disease. It's a symptom that may have different causes. \", \" At first, parents may think their child has a simple case of diarrhea. But when it keeps happening, it's clear that there's another problem, especially because the child isn't sick.  As the buildup of stool stretches the colon, the nerves have trouble telling the brain that it's time for a BM. If untreated, the soiling will get worse. Then, kids may lose their appetites or complain of stomach pain.  A large, hard poop may also cause a tear in the skin around the anus that will leave blood on the stools, the toilet paper, or in the toilet.  Parents can get frustrated if their child seems unfazed by the poop accidents, which happen mostly during waking hours. Denial may be one reason for a child seeming calm — kids can't face the shame and guilt they feel about the condition. Some even try to hide their soiled underpants from their parents.  Another reason may be more scientific: Because the brain gets used to the smell of poop, the child may no longer notice the odor. \", ' Most encopresis cases are due to constipation. Stool (poop) is hard, dry, and difficult to pass when a person is constipated. Many kids \"hold\" their BMs to avoid the pain they feel when they go to the bathroom, which sets the stage for having a poop accident. ', ' There\\'s a wide range when it comes to \"normal\" pooping. One kid might have one or two BMs per day while another goes only three or four times a week.  A child who passes a soft, medium-sized BM without any problems every 3 days is not constipated. But a child who passes a hard BM (small or large) every other day is. So are other kids who may go every day, but only pass hard little balls and always have poop left behind in the rectum.  Causes of hard poop can include:  diet  illness  not drinking enough liquids  fear of the toilet during potty training  limited access to a toilet or a toilet that\\'s not private (like at school)  Some kids may develop chronic constipation after stressful life events such as a divorce or the death of a close relative.  Rectal surgery or birth defects such as Hirschsprung disease and spina bifida can cause constipation or encopresis without constipation, but this is uncommon. ', \" When a child holds in BMs, the poop starts building up\\xa0in the rectum and may back up into the colon — and a frustrating cycle begins.  The colon's job is to remove water from the poop before it's passed. The longer the poop is stuck there, the more water is removed — and the harder it is to push the large, dry poop out. The large poop also stretches out the colon, weakening the muscles there and affecting the nerves that tell a child when it's time to go to the bathroom.  Then, the colon can't easily push the hard poop out, and it's painful to pass. So the child continues to avoid having a BM, often by dancing, crossing the legs, making faces, or walking on tiptoes.  In time, the rectum and lower part of the colon get so full that it's hard for the sphincter (the muscular valve that controls the passage of feces out of the anus) to hold the poop in. Partial BMs may pass through, causing the child to soil his or her pants. Softer poop may also leak out around the large mass of feces and stain the child's underwear when the sphincter relaxes.  Kids can't prevent this soiling — nor do they have any idea it's happening — because the nerves aren't sending the signals that regulate pooping. \", \" Call the doctor if your child has any of these symptoms of encopresis:  poop or liquid stool in the underwear when your child isn't ill  hard poop or pain when having a BM  toilet-clogging BM  belly pain  loss of appetite  blood on the toilet paper when wiping or dripping into the toilet bowl  Soiling and constipation are a top reason that kids go to see pediatric gastroenterologists (doctors who diagnose and treat disorders of the stomach and intestines). \", \" Encopresis is not a behavioral issue or a simple lack of self-control. Punishing or humiliating a child with encopresis will only make matters worse.  Instead, talk to your doctor for help to get through this challenging but treatable problem. The doctor also might recommend that your child see a gastroenterologist.  Treatment happens in three phases:  Emptying the rectum and colon of the hard poop.\\xa0Depending on the child's age and other things, the doctor may recommend medicines, including a stool softener, laxatives, and/or enemas. Give laxatives and enemas only under the supervision of a doctor. Never give these treatments at home without first checking with your doctor.  Helping your child begin having regular BMs.\\xa0This is done with the aid of stool-softening agents. It's important to continue using the stool softeners/laxatives to give the bowels a chance to shrink back to normal size. The muscles of the intestines are stretched out, so they need time to recover.  Parents also will be asked to schedule potty times after meals (when the bowels are naturally stimulated). The child will sit on the toilet for about 5 to 10 minutes. This helps kids learn to pay attention to the urges to go.  Reducing use of the stool medicines. As regular BMs happen, the doctor will decrease a child's use of stool softeners and/or laxatives.  Keep in mind that relapses are normal, so don't get discouraged. Your child might get constipated again or soil their pants during treatment, especially when being weaned off of the stool softeners.  A good way to track your child's progress is by keeping a daily poop calendar. Make sure to note the frequency, consistency (hard, soft, dry), and size (large, small) of the BMs.  Patience is the key to treating encopresis. It can take several months to a year for the stretched-out colon to return to its normal size and for the nerves in the colon to become effective again. \", \" Diet and exercise are very important in keeping stools soft and BMs regular. Make sure your child gets plenty of fiber-rich foods. Serve\\xa0fresh fruits, dried fruits like prunes and raisins, dried beans, vegetables, and high-fiber bread and cereal.  Try these creative ways to add it to your child's diet:  Bake cookies or muffins using whole-wheat flour instead of regular flour. Add raisins, chopped or pureed apples, or prunes to the mix.  Add bran to baking items such as cookies and muffins, or to meatloaf or burgers, or sprinkled on cereal. (The trick is not to add too much bran or the food will taste like sawdust.)  Serve apples topped with peanut butter.  Create tasty treats with peanut butter and whole-wheat crackers.  Top ice cream, frozen yogurt, or regular yogurt with high-fiber cereal for some added crunch.  Serve bran waffles topped with fruit.  Make pancakes with whole-grain pancake mix and top with peaches, apricots, or grapes.  Top high-fiber cereal with fruit.  Sneak some raisins or pureed prunes or zucchini into whole-wheat pancakes.  Add shredded carrots or pureed zucchini to spaghetti sauce or macaroni and cheese.  Add lentils to soup.  Make bean burritos with whole-grain soft-taco shells.  Help your child drink plenty of liquids each day, especially water. Diluted 100% fruit juice (like pear, peach, or prune) is an option if your child isn't drinking enough water. Also, limiting your child's daily dairy intake (including milk, cheese, and yogurt) may help. \", \" Successful treatment of encopresis depends on the support a child gets. Some parents find that positive reinforcement helps to encourage the child throughout treatment. For instance, put a star or sticker on the poop calendar for having a BM (or even for trying to), sitting on the toilet, or taking medicines.  Don't blame or yell — it will only make your child feel bad and it won't help manage the condition. With lots of love, support, and reassurance that they're not the only one in the world with this problem, your child can overcome encopresis. \", \" Parents  Kids  How to Handle Constipation  Constipation  Hirschsprung Disease  Bedwetting (Enuresis)  Toilet Training  What's Encopresis?

This might make them:  repeat certain syllables, words, or phrases  prolong them  stop, making no sound for certain sounds and syllables  Stuttering is a form of dysfluency\\xa0(dis-FLOO-en-see), an interruption in the flow of speech.  In many cases, stuttering goes away on its own by age 5. In some kids, it goes on for longer. Effective treatments are available to help a child overcome it. ', \" Doctors and scientists aren't completely sure why some kids stutter. But most believe that a few things contribute to it, such as a problem with the way the brain's messages interact with the muscles and body parts needed for speaking.  Many believe that stuttering may be genetic. Kids who stutter are three times more likely to have a close family member who also stutters, or did. \", \" The first signs of stuttering tend to appear when a child is about 18–24 months old. At this age, there's a burst in vocabulary and kids are starting to put words together to form sentences. To parents, the stuttering may be upsetting and frustrating, but it is natural for kids to do some stuttering at this stage. Be as patient with your child as possible.  A child may stutter for a few weeks or several months, and the stuttering may come and go. Most kids who begin stuttering before the age of 5 stop without any need for help such as speech or language therapy.  But if your child's stuttering happens a lot, gets worse, or happens along with body or facial movements, seeing a speech-language therapist around age 3 is a good idea.  Usually, stuttering lets up when kids enter elementary school and start sharpening their communication skills. A school-age child who continues to stutter is likely aware of the problem and may be embarrassed by it. Classmates and friends may draw attention to it or even tease the child.  If this happens with your child, talk to the teacher, who can address this in the classroom with the kids. The teacher also might decrease the number of stressful speaking situations for your child until speech therapy begins. \", \" If your child is 5 years old and still stuttering, talk to your doctor or a speech-language therapist. Check with a speech therapist if your child:  tries to avoid situations that require talking  changes a word for fear of stuttering  has facial or body movements along with the stuttering  repeats whole words and phrases often and consistently  repeats sounds and syllables more often  has speech that sounds very strained  Also talk to the therapist if:  you notice increased facial tension or tightness in your child's speech muscles  you notice vocal tension that causes rising pitch or loudness  you have other concerns about your child's speech  Most schools will offer testing and appropriate therapy if stuttering lasts for 6 months or more. \", ' Try these steps to help your child:  Don\\'t require your child to speak precisely or correctly at all times. Let talking be fun and enjoyable.  Use family meals as a conversation time. Avoid distractions such as radio or TV.  Avoid corrections or criticisms such as \"slow down,\" \"take your time,\" or \"take a deep breath.\" These comments, however well-intentioned, will only make your child feel more self-conscious.  Avoid having your child speak or read aloud when uncomfortable or when the stuttering increases. Instead, during these times encourage activities that do not require a lot of talking.  Don\\'t interrupt your child or tell them to start over.  Don\\'t tell your child to think before speaking.  Provide a calm atmosphere in the home. Try to slow down the pace of family life.  Speak slowly and clearly when talking to your child or others in their presence.  Maintain eye contact with your child. Try not to look away or show signs of being upset.  Let your child speak for themself and to finish thoughts and sentences. Pause before responding to your child\\'s questions or comments.  Talk slowly to your child. This takes practice! Modeling a slow rate of speech will help with your child\\'s fluency.

But instead of looking at them as disasters, treat tantrums as opportunities for education. ', ' Temper tantrums range from whining and crying to screaming, kicking, hitting, and breath-holding spells. They\\'re equally common in boys and girls and usually happen between the ages of 1 to 3.  Some kids may have tantrums often, and others have them rarely. Tantrums are a normal part of child development. They\\'re how young children show that they\\'re upset or frustrated.  Tantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable. They can have a meltdown because they can\\'t have something they want (like a toy or candy) or can’t get someone to do what they want (like getting a parent to pay attention to them immediately or getting a sibling to give up the tablet). Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time.  Tantrums are common during the second year of life, when language skills are developing. Because toddlers can\\'t always say what they want or need, and because words describing feelings are more complicated and develop later, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease.  Toddlers want independence and control over their environment — more than they can actually handle. This can lead to power struggles as a child thinks \"I can do it myself\" or \"I want it, give it to me.\" When kids discover that they can\\'t do it and can\\'t have everything they want, they may have\\xa0a tantrum. ', ' Try to prevent tantrums from happening\\xa0in the first place, whenever possible. Here are some ideas that may help:  Give plenty of positive attention. Get in the habit of catching your child being good. Reward your little one with praise and attention for positive behavior. Be specific about praising behaviors you want to see happen more often (such as, “I like the way you said please and waited for your milk” or “Thank you for sharing the blocks with your sister.”)  Try to give toddlers some control over little things. Offer minor choices such as \"Do you want orange juice or apple juice?\" or \"Do you want to brush your teeth before or after taking a bath?\" This way, you aren\\'t asking \"Do you want to brush your teeth now?\" — which of course will be answered \"no.\"\\xa0Allow control when it doesn’t really matter. Instead of struggling over an outfit your child puts on that doesn’t match, for example, consider whether this may be an opportunity to allow self-expression and independence and if it really makes a difference given the day\\'s schedule.  Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach. This makes struggles less likely. Obviously, this isn\\'t always possible, especially outside of the home where the environment can\\'t be controlled.  Distract your child. Try offering something else in place of what they can\\'t have. Start\\xa0a new activity to replace the frustrating or forbidden one (for example, if your child is jumping on the couch, ask them to come help you “cook” by offering a plastic container and wooden spoon. Then you can praise them for helping or following directions, rather than having them start a tantrum or refuse to get down). Or simply change the environment. Take your toddler outside or inside or move to a different room.  Help kids learn new skills and succeed. Help kids learn to do things. Praise them to help them feel proud of what they can do. Also, start with something simple before moving on to more challenging tasks.  Consider the request carefully when your child wants something. Is it outrageous? Maybe it isn\\'t. Choose your battles.\\xa0It\\'s even OK to change your mind if you originally said no\\xa0— but find a way to allow the desired treat as a reward for good behavior.  Know your child\\'s limits. If you know your toddler is tired, it\\'s not the best time to go grocery shopping or try to squeeze in one more errand.\\xa0Hungry kids are more likely to demand food in the store than children who have just had a meal (just like adults!). ', \" Keep your cool when responding to a tantrum. Don't complicate the problem with your own frustration or anger. Remind yourself that your job is helping your child learn to calm down. So you need to be calm too.  Tantrums should be handled differently depending on why your child is upset. Sometimes, you may need to provide comfort. If your child is tired or hungry, it's time for a nap or a snack. Other times, its best to ignore an outburst or distract your child with a new activity.  If a tantrum is happening to get attention from parents, one of the best ways to reduce this behavior is to ignore it. If a tantrum happens after your child is refused something, stay calm and don't give a lot of explanations for why your child can't have what they want. Move on to another activity with your child.  If a tantrum happens after your child is told to do something they don't want to do, it's best to ignore the tantrum. But be sure that you follow through on having your child complete the task after they're calm.  Kids who are in danger of hurting themselves or others during a tantrum should be taken to a quiet, safe place to calm down. This also applies to tantrums in public places.  If a safety issue is involved and a toddler repeats the forbidden behavior after being told to stop, use a time-out by sitting the child on a designated chair or in the corner for just a few minutes. Be nearby so that you can supervise, but do not interact until they are calm. Be consistent. Don't give in on safety issues.  Preschoolers and older kids are more likely to use tantrums to get their way if they've learned that this behavior works. For school-age kids, it's appropriate to send them to their rooms to cool off while paying little attention to the behavior.  Let your child know that you will tell them when the time-out is over and that the sooner they are calm and quiet, the sooner it will end. This is empowering — kids can affect the outcome by their own actions, and thus gain a sense of control that was lost during the tantrum.  Do not reward your child's tantrum by giving in. This will only prove to your little one that the tantrum was effective.  Consider making a “chill out” or “calm down” spot in your home (some teachers use this in preschool, as well). Use a soft cushion and provide books, a stuffed animal, some soft music, and other calming activities in a place where others won’t disturb the child. Encourage your child to go to the spot when angry or upset\\xa0— not as a punishment, but as a choice and an opportunity to learn to calm down and control frustration. \", ' Praise your child for regaining control\\xa0— for example, \"I like how you calmed down.\"  Kids may be especially vulnerable after a tantrum when they know they\\'ve been less than adorable. Now (when your child is calm)\\xa0is the time for a hug and reassurance that your child is loved, no matter what.\\xa0If your child is old enough to discuss the problem, help them come up with some other ways they might have expressed their frustration.  Make sure your child gets enough sleep. With too little sleep, kids can become hyper, disagreeable, and have extremes in behavior. Getting enough sleep can greatly reduce tantrums. Find out how much sleep is needed at your child’s age. Most kids\\' sleep needs fall within a set range of hours based on their age, but each child is unique. ', \" Talk to your doctor if:  You often feel angry or out of control when you respond to tantrums.  You keep giving in to try to avoid your child acting out.  The tantrums cause a lot of bad feelings between you and your child or you and your partner.  The tantrums happen more often, are more intense, or last longer.  Your child often self-harms or hurts others.  Your child seems very disagreeable, argues a lot, and hardly ever cooperates.  Your doctor also can check for any health problems that may add to the tantrums, although this is not common. Sometimes, hearing or vision problems, a chronic illness, language delays, or a learning disability can make kids more likely to have tantrums.  Remember, tantrums usually aren't cause for concern and generally stop on their own. As kids mature, they gain self-control. They learn to cooperate, communicate, and cope with frustration. Less frustration and more control will mean fewer tantrums — and happier parents. \", \" Parents  Teaching Your Child Self-Control  Disciplining Your Child  How Can Parents Discipline Without Spanking?

Instead of using age, look for signs that your child may be ready to start heading for the potty, such as being able to:  follow simple instructions  understand and use words about using the potty  make the connection between the urge to pee or poop and using the potty  keep a diaper dry for 2 hours or more  get to the potty, sit on it for enough time, and then get off the potty  pull down diapers, disposable training pants, or underpants  show an interest in using the potty or wearing underpants  Most children begin to show these signs when they\\'re between 18 and 24 months old, though some may not be ready until later than that. And boys often start later and take longer to learn to use the potty than girls.  There are some times when you may want to put off starting toilet training, such as:  when traveling  around the birth of a sibling  changing from the crib to the bed  moving to a new house  when your child is sick (especially if diarrhea is a factor) ', \" Teaching a toddler to use the potty isn't an overnight task. It often takes between 3 and 6 months, but can take more or less time for some children. If you start too soon, the process tends to take longer.\\xa0And it can take months to even years to master staying dry at night. \", \" The two basic potty options are:  a standalone, toddler-size potty chair with a bowl that can be emptied into the toilet  a toddler-size seat that can be placed on top of a toilet seat that will let your child feel more secure and not fear falling in. If you choose this, get a stepping stool so your child can reach the seat comfortably and feel supported while having a bowel movement.  It's usually best for boys to first learn to use the toilet sitting down before learning to pee standing up. For boys who feel awkward — or scared — about standing on a stool to pee in the toilet, a potty chair may be a better option.  You may want to get a training potty or seat for every bathroom in your house. You may even want to keep a potty in the trunk of your car for emergencies. When traveling long distances, be sure to take a potty seat with you and stop every 1 to 2 hours. Otherwise, it can take too long to find a restroom. \", \" Disposable training pants are a helpful step between diapers and underwear. Because kids' nighttime bladder and bowel control often lags behind their daytime control, some parents like using training pants at night. Others prefer that their child use training pants when they're out and about. Once the training pants remain dry for a few days, kids can make the switch to wearing underwear.  But some people think that disposable training pants might make kids think it's OK to use them like diapers, thus slowing the toilet-teaching process.  Ask your doctor if your child would benefit from using disposable training pants as a transitional step. \", ' Even before your child is ready to try the potty, you can prepare your little one by teaching about the process:  Use words to express the act of using the toilet (\"pee,\" \"poop,\" and \"potty\").  Ask your child to let you know when a diaper is wet or soiled.  Identify behaviors (\"Are you going poop?\") so that your child can learn to recognize the urge to pee and poop.  Get a potty chair your child can practice sitting on. At first, your child can sit on it wearing clothes or a diaper. When ready, your child can go bare-bottomed.  If you\\'ve decided that your child is ready to start learning how to use the potty, these tips may help:  Set aside some time to devote to the potty-training process.  Don\\'t make your child sit on the toilet against his or her will.  Show your child how you sit on the toilet and explain what you\\'re doing (because your child learns by watching you). You also can have your child sit on the potty seat and watch while you (or a sibling) use the toilet.  Establish a routine. For example, you may want to begin by having your child sit on the potty after waking with a dry diaper, or 45 minutes to an hour after drinking lots of liquids. Only put your child on the potty for a few minutes a couple of times a day, and let your child get up if he or she wants to.  Have your child sit on the potty within 15 to 30 minutes after meals to take advantage of the body\\'s natural tendency to have a bowel movement after eating (this is called the gastro-colic reflex). Also, many kids have a time of day they tend to have a bowel movement.  Ask your child to sit on the potty if you see clear clues of needing to go to the bathroom, such as crossing legs, grunting, or squatting.  Empty a bowel movement (poop) from your child\\'s diaper into the toilet, and tell your child that poop goes in the potty.  Avoid clothes that are hard to take off, such as overalls and shirts that snap in the crotch. Kids who are potty training need to be able to undress themselves.  Offer your child small rewards, such as stickers or time reading, every time your child goes in the potty. Keep a chart to track of successes. Once your little one appears to be mastering the use of the toilet, let him or her pick out a few new pairs of big-kid underwear to wear.  Make sure all caregivers — including babysitters, grandparents, and childcare workers — follow the same routine and use the same names for body parts and bathroom acts. Let them know how you\\'re handling toilet training and ask that they use the same approaches so your child won\\'t be confused.  Praise all attempts to use the toilet, even if nothing happens. And remember that accidents will happen. It\\'s important not to punish potty-training children or show disappointment when they wet or soil themselves or the bed. Instead, tell your child that it was an accident and offer your support. Reassure your child that he or she is well on the way to using the potty like a big kid. ', \" Many kids who've been using the potty have some trouble during times of stress. For example, a 2- or 3-year-old dealing with a new sibling may start having accidents.  But if your child was potty-trained and is regularly having problems, talk with your doctor.  Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about toilet training or your child is 4 years or older and is not yet potty trained. \", \" Parents  Kids  Soiling (Encopresis)  Bedwetting (Enuresis)  Talking to Your Child's Preschool Teacher  Managing Your Toddler's Behavior (Video)  Potty Training Your Child (Video)  Bedwetting  Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Pinterest  About Us  Contact Us  Partners  Editorial Policy  Permissions Guidelines  Privacy Policy & Terms of Use  Notice of Nondiscrimination  Note: All information on Nemours KidsHealth is for educational purposes only.

They include:  generalized anxiety disorder  separation anxiety disorder  social anxiety disorder  panic disorder  selective mutism  specific phobias  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD causes kids to worry almost every day — and over lots of things. Kids with GAD worry over things that most kids worry about, like homework, tests, or making mistakes.  But with GAD, kids worry more, and more often, about these things. Kids with GAD also worry over things parents might not expect would cause worry. For example, they might worry about recess, lunchtime, birthday parties, playtime with friends, or riding the school bus. Kids with GAD may also worry about war, weather, or the future. Or about loved ones, safety, illness, or getting hurt.  Having GAD can make it hard for kids to focus in school. Because with GAD, there is almost always a worry on a kid's mind. GAD makes it hard for kids to relax and have fun, eat well, or fall asleep at night. They may miss many days of school because worry makes them feel sick, afraid, or tired.  Some kids with GAD keep worries to themselves. Others talk about their worries with a parent or teacher. They might ask over and over whether something they worry about will happen. But it's hard for them to feel OK, no matter what a parent says.  Separation anxiety disorder. It's normal for babies and very young kids to feel anxious the first times they are apart from their parent. But soon they get used to being with a grandparent, babysitter, or teacher. And they start to feel at home at daycare or school.  But when kids don't outgrow the fear of being apart from a parent, it's called separation anxiety disorder. Even as they get older, kids with separation anxiety disorder feel very anxious about being away from their parent or away from home. They may miss many days of school. They may say they feel too sick or upset to go. They may cling to a parent, cry, or refuse to go to school, sleepovers, playdates, or other activities without their parent. At home, they may have trouble falling asleep or sleeping alone. They may avoid being in a room at home if their parent isn't close by.  Social phobia (social anxiety disorder). With social phobia, kids to feel too afraid of what others will think or say. They are always afraid they might do or say something embarrassing. They worry they might sound or look weird. They don't like to be the center of attention. They don't want others to notice them, so they might avoid raising their hand in class. If they get called on in class, they may freeze or panic and can't answer. With social phobia, a class presentation or a group activity with classmates can cause extreme fear.  Social phobia can cause kids and teens to avoid school or friends. They may feel sick or tired before or during school. They may complain of other body sensations that go with anxiety too. For example, they may feel their heart racing or feel short of breath. They may feel jumpy and feel they can't sit still. They may feel their face get hot or blush. They may feel shaky or lightheaded.  Panic disorder. These sudden anxiety attacks can cause overwhelming physicals symptoms, such as feeling shaky or jittery, trembling, a racing heart rate, and shortness of breath. Panic attacks can happen any time. They’re more common in teens than kids.  Selective mutism. This extreme form of social phobia causes kids to be so afraid they don't talk. Kids and teens who have it\\xa0can talk. And they do talk at home or with their closest people. But they refuse to talk at all at school, with friends, or in other places where they have this fear.  Specific phobias. It's normal for young kids to feel scared of the dark, monsters, big animals, or loud noises like thunder or fireworks. Most of the time, when kids feel afraid, adults can help them feel safe and calm again. But a phobia is a more intense, more extreme, and longer lasting fear of a specific thing. With a phobia, a child dreads the thing they fear and tries to avoid it. If they are near what they fear, they feel terrified and are hard to comfort.  With a specific phobia, kids may have an extreme fear of things like animals, spiders, needles or shots, blood, throwing up, thunderstorms, people in costumes, or the dark. A phobia causes kids to avoid going places where they think they might see the thing they fear. For example, a kid with a phobia of dogs may not go to a friend's house, to a park, or to a party because dogs might be there. \", ' A parent or teacher may see signs that a child or teen is anxious. For example, a kid might cling, miss school, or cry. They might act scared or upset, or refuse to talk or do things. Kids and teens with anxiety also feel symptoms that others can\\'t see. It can make them feel afraid, worried, or nervous.  It can affect their body too. They might feel shaky, jittery, or short of breath. They may feel \"butterflies\" in their stomach, a hot face, clammy hands, dry mouth, or a racing heart.  These symptoms of anxiety are the result of the \"fight or flight\" response. This is the body\\'s normal response to danger. It triggers the release of natural chemicals in the body. These chemicals prepare us to deal with a real danger. They affect heart rate, breathing, muscles, nerves, and digestion. This response is meant to protect us from danger. But with anxiety disorders, the \"fight or flight\" response is overactive. It happens even when there is no real danger. ', ' Several things play a role in causing the overactive \"fight or flight\" that happens with anxiety disorders. They include:  Genetics. A child who has a family member with an anxiety disorder is more likely to have one too. Kids may inherit genes that make them prone to anxiety.  Brain chemistry. Genes help direct the way brain chemicals (called neurotransmitters) work. If specific brain chemicals are in short supply, or not working well, it can cause anxiety.  Life situations. Things that happen in a child\\'s life can be stressful and difficult to cope with. Loss, serious illness, death of a loved one, violence, or abuse can lead some kids to become anxious.  Learned behaviors.\\xa0Growing up in a family where others are fearful or anxious also can \"teach\" a child to be afraid too. ', \" Anxiety disorders can be diagnosed by a trained therapist. They talk with you and your child, ask questions, and listen carefully. They'll ask how and when the child's anxiety and fears happen most. That helps them diagnose the specific anxiety disorder the child has.  A child or teen with symptoms of anxiety should also have a regular health checkup. This helps make sure no other health problem is causing the symptoms. \", \" Most often, anxiety disorders are treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). This is a type of talk therapy that helps families, kids, and teens learn to manage worry, fear, and anxiety.  CBT teaches kids that what they think and do affects how they feel. In CBT, kids learn that when they avoid what they fear, the fear stays strong. They learn that when they face a fear, the fear gets weak and goes away.  In CBT:  Parents learn how to best respond when a child is anxious. They learn how to help kids face fears.  Kids learn coping skills so they can face fear and worry less.  The therapist helps kids practice, and gives support and praise as they try. Over time, kids learn to face fears and feel better. They learn to get used to situations they're afraid of. They feel proud of what they've learned. And without so many worries, they can focus on other things — like school, activities, and fun. Sometimes, medicines are also used to help treat anxiety. \", \" If your child has an anxiety disorder, here are some ways you can help:  Find a trained therapist and take your child to all the therapy appointments.  Talk often with the therapist, and ask how you can best help your child.  Help your child face fears. Ask the therapist how you can help your child practice at home. Praise your child for efforts to cope with fears and worry.  Help kids talk about feelings. Listen, and let them know you understand, love, and accept them. A caring relationship with you helps your child build inner strengths.  Encourage your child to take small steps forward. Don't let your child give up or avoid what they're afraid of. Help them take small positive steps forward.  Be patient. It takes a while for therapy to work and for kids to feel better.  Helping Your Child Manage Anxiety                                            Feeling nervous, worried, or uneasy at times is a normal part of growing up.

What's the best way to help your family get through a divorce? Every situation — and every family — is different. But these suggestions can make the process less painful for kids, teens, and families. \", ' It\\'s important for divorcing — and already divorced — parents to sit down with their kids and encourage them to say what they\\'re thinking and feeling.\\xa0This can be challenging for parents as it may be painful to hear, but try to keep focused on their feelings and perspectives, rather than your own. Assure your kids that their feelings are important, valid, and normal. Let them know that you can handle a conversation about even difficult or painful feelings.  During these conversations, avoid problem-solving and trying to change the way a child feels. Instead, focus on listening and thanking kids for their honesty. Kids often feel a loss of family and may blame you or the other parent — or both — for what\\'s going on in their lives. So, you\\'ll need to be ready to stay calm and answer questions your kids might raise or to address their concerns.  Make talking about the divorce and how it\\'s affecting your kids an ongoing process. As they get older and become more mature, kids might have questions or concerns that they hadn\\'t thought of earlier. Even if it seems like you\\'ve gone over the same topics before, keep the dialogue open. If possible, sit down with the other parent and plan how you\\'re going to talk about what\\'s going on.  If you feel like you may get too upset or have trouble staying calm, ask someone else (a relative or family friend they trust) to talk to your kids. It\\'s OK and healthy for kids to see their parents feeling sad or upset, but children can feel responsible for their parents\\' feelings if the emotions become overwhelming.  If your children do see you struggle with a difficult emotion, model healthy coping as much as possible. Try to:  Label your emotion for them (\"I\\'m feeling sad right now.\").  State that you know it\\'s OK to feel this way sometimes (\"It\\'s OK and normal for me to feel sad\").  Talk about how you\\'ll cope with your tough feelings (\"Something that always helps me feel better when I\\'m sad is baking cookies with you or playing outside. Let\\'s go do it!\").  It\\'s natural for kids to have many emotions about a divorce. They might feel guilty and imagine that they \"caused\" the problem. This is particularly true if kids overheard their parents arguing about them. Kids and teens may feel angry or frightened, or worried about their future. If they voice these emotions, reassure them that this was not the case while reminding them that it\\'s a normal feeling.  Although kids may struggle with a divorce for quite a while, the real impact is usually felt over about a 2- to 3-year period. During this time, some can voice their feelings. But, depending on their age and development, other kids just won\\'t have the words.\\xa0They may instead act out behaviorally or struggle with their mood. For school-age kids, this might mean their grades drop or they lose interest in activities. For younger children, these feelings are often expressed during play too. Be aware of a \"sleeper effect\" with young children: They might take big changes in stride at first, but disruptive behaviors or challenging emotions can come up years later. Communicating openly with kids and modeling healthy coping, even if they seem OK with the big changes, can reduce trouble down the road.  It may be tempting to tell a child not to feel a certain way, but kids (and adults, for that matter) have a right to their feelings. And if you try to force a \"happy face,\" your kids may be less likely to share their true feelings with you.  Group programs for kids of divorce run by schools or faith-based organizations are an excellent resource for kids and families who need some help to get through these early stages. ', \" As hard as it may be, it's important to never say bad things about your ex in front of your kids or within earshot. Kids pick up on negativity and may understand what’s being said even if you think they are too young to do so. Research shows that the single biggest factor in long-term adjustment for kids of divorce is the level of parental conflict they see. It puts kids in a tough spot if they have to take sides or listen to negative things said about one of their parents.  It's just as important to acknowledge real events. If, for example, one spouse moves out or leaves the family, acknowledge what has happened. It isn't your responsibility to explain your ex's behavior. But if your kids ask you questions, it's important to answer as neutrally and as truthfully as possible. \", ' Even though it is tempting, don\\'t use your kids as messengers. There are plenty of other ways to communicate with your ex-partner. Also, resist questioning your child about what\\'s happening in the other household. Kids resent it when they feel that they\\'re being asked to \"spy\" on the other parent. Wherever possible, communicate directly with the other parent about things like scheduling, visitation, health issues, or school problems. ', ' New relationships, blended families, and remarriages are among the hardest parts of the divorce process. A new, blended family can add more stress at first, and lead to another period of adjustment. Keep lines of communication open, allow one-on-one time for parents and kids, and watch for signs of stress to help prevent problems. ', \" Support from friends, relatives, church and religious groups, and organizations such as Parents Without Partners can help parents and their kids adjust to separation and divorce. Kids can meet peers who've successfully navigated their parents’ divorce, new partners, and new family dynamics and can confide in each other. Getting support can help parents find solutions to all kinds of practical and emotional challenges.  Parents also need to remember to take care of themselves. Reduce stress by finding supportive friends and asking for help when you need it. Try to keep some old family traditions while building new memories to share. Showing your kids how to take good care of mind and body during hard times can help them become more resilient in their own lives.  Remember that honesty, sensitivity, self-awareness, and time itself will help the healing process. \", \" Parents  Kids  Teens  Taking Your Child to a Therapist  Childhood Stress: How Parents Can Help  Sibling Rivalry  Coping With Sad Feelings  Going to a Therapist  Stress  Coping When a Parent Has an Alcohol or Drug Problem  What Is Stress?

Around the first birthday, many kids develop separation anxiety, getting upset when a parent, grandparent, or other primary caregiver tries to leave them with someone else.  Though separation anxiety is a perfectly normal part of childhood development, it can be unsettling.  Understanding what your child is going through and having a few ways to cope ready can help both of you get through it. \", ' Babies adapt pretty well to other caregivers. Parents probably feel more anxiety about being separated than infants do! As long as their needs are being met, most babies younger than 6 months adjust easily to other people.  Between 4–7 months of age, babies develop a sense of \"object permanence.\"\\xa0They\\'re realizing that things and people exist even when they\\'re out of sight. Babies learn that when they can\\'t see their caregiver, that means they\\'ve gone away. They don\\'t understand the concept of time, so they don\\'t know that this person will come back, and can become upset by their absence. For example, whether the caregiver is in the kitchen, in the next bedroom, or at the office, it\\'s all the same to the baby, who might cry until mom is nearby again.  Kids between 8 months and 1 year old are growing into more independent toddlers, yet are even more uncertain about being separated from a parent. This is when separation anxiety develops, and children may become agitated and upset when a parent tries to leave.  Whether you need to go into the next room for just a few seconds, leave your child with a sitter for the evening, or drop off your child at daycare, your child might now react by crying, clinging to you, and resisting attention from others.  The timing of separation anxiety can vary. Some kids might go through it later, between 18 months and 2½ years of age. Some never experience it. And for others, certain life stresses can trigger feelings of anxiety about being separated from a parent: a new childcare situation or caregiver, a new sibling, moving to a new place, or tension at home. ', \" How long separation anxiety lasts can vary, depending on the child and how family memebers respond. In some cases, depending on a child's temperament, separation anxiety can last from infancy through the elementary school years.  Separation anxiety that affects an older child's normal activities can be a sign of a deeper anxiety disorder. If separation anxiety appears out of the blue in an older child, there might be another problem, like bullying or abuse.  Separation anxiety is different from the normal feelings older kids have when they don't want a parent to leave (which can usually be overcome if a child is distracted enough).\\xa0And older kids do understand that their behavior can affect parents. If you run back into the room every time your child cries or cancel your plans, your child will continue to use this tactic to avoid separation. \", \" Separation anxiety might have you feeling a variety of emotions. It can be nice to feel that your child is finally as attached to you as you are to them. But you're also likely to feel guilty about taking time out for yourself, leaving your child with another caregiver, or going to work. And you may start to feel overwhelmed by the amount of attention your child seems to need from you.  Keep in mind that your little one's unwillingness to leave you is a good sign that healthy attachments have developed between the two of you. Eventually, your child will be able to remember that you always return after you leave, and that will be comfort enough\\xa0while you're gone. This also gives kids a chance to develop coping skills and a little independence. \", ' These tips can help ease kids and parents through this difficult period:  Timing matters. Try not to start daycare or childcare with an unfamiliar person when your child is between the ages of 8 months and 1 year, when separation anxiety is first likely to appear. Also, try not to leave when your child is tired, hungry, or restless. If at all possible, schedule your departures for after naps and mealtimes.  Practice. Practice being apart from each other, and introduce new people and places slowly. If you plan to leave your child with a relative or a new babysitter, invite that person over in advance so they can spend time together while you\\'re in the room. If your child is starting at a new daycare center or preschool, make a few visits there together before a full-time schedule begins. Practice leaving your child with a caregiver for short periods so that they can get used to being away from you.  Be calm and consistent. Create an exit ritual during which you say a pleasant, loving, and firm goodbye. Stay calm and show confidence in your child. Reassure them that you\\'ll be back — and explain when you\\'ll return using concepts kids will understand (such as after lunch). Give your full attention when you say goodbye, and when you say you\\'re leaving, mean it; coming back will only make things worse.  Follow through on promises. It\\'s important to make sure that you return when you have promised to. This is critical — this is how your child will develop the confidence that they can make it through the time apart.  As hard as it may be to leave a child who\\'s screaming and crying for you, it\\'s important to have confidence that the caregiver can handle it. By the time you get to your car, your child is likely to have calmed down and be playing with other things.  If you\\'re caring for another person\\'s child who\\'s having separation anxiety, try to distract the child with an activity or toy, or with songs, games, or anything else that\\'s fun. You may have to keep trying until something just clicks with the child.  Also, try to distract the child from thinking about missing their family, but do answer the child\\'s questions in a simple and straightforward way to reassure them. You might say: \"Your parents are going to be back as soon as they\\'re done dinner. It’s OK to miss them, but let\\'s play with some toys!\" ', \" Remember, this phase will pass. If your child has never been cared for by anyone but you, is naturally shy, or has other stresses, separation anxiety may be worse than it is for other kids.  Also, trust your instincts. If your child refuses to go to a certain babysitter or daycare center or shows other signs of tensions, such as trouble sleeping or loss of appetite, there could be a problem with the childcare situation.  If intense separation anxiety lasts into preschool, elementary school, or beyond and interferes with daily activities, discuss it with your doctor. It could be a sign of a more significant concern known as separation anxiety disorder. Kids with this disorder fear being apart from their family members and are often convinced that something bad will happen. Talk with your doctor if your child has signs of this, including:  panic symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath) or panic attacks before a parent leaves  nightmares about separation  fear of sleeping alone (although this is also common in kids who don't have separation anxiety)  excessive worry about being lost or kidnapped or going places without a parent  For most kids, the anxiety of being apart from a parent or primary caregiver passes without any need for medical attention. But if you have concerns, talk to your doctor. \", \" Parents  Childhood Stress: How Parents Can Help  Helping Your Child Adjust to Preschool  Normal Childhood Fears  Learning, Play, and Your  8- to 12-Month-Old  Communication and Your 8- to 12-Month-Old  Communication and Your 1- to 2-Year-Old  Managing Your Toddler's Behavior (Video)  Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Pinterest  About Us  Contact Us  Partners  Editorial Policy  Permissions Guidelines  Privacy Policy & Terms of Use  Notice of Nondiscrimination  Note: All information on Nemours KidsHealth is for educational purposes only.

Starting school. Meeting new friends. Learning to swim. Competing in sports. Learning to drive. Each new thing can feel like a big step forward.  When kids and teens face new things, they often feel a mix of emotions. Facing something new — even when it\\'s a good thing — can be stressful. It\\'s natural to feel excited about what\\'s ahead — and to worry about whether they\\'re ready to handle it.  Worry isn\\'t all bad. It can be helpful as long as it doesn\\'t last too long, become too intense, or happen too often.  Worry is a caution signal. It\\'s a natural response to a big event, change, or challenge. Worry is a way of thinking and feeling ahead: \"Am I ready for this? What\\'s going to happen? Is it safe to go ahead? What do I need to do to get ready? How will I do it? What if I feel nervous?\"  Thinking through the part they worry about — calmly and with support from parents — can help kids get ready for what\\'s ahead. When kids feel prepared, they can focus on the part they\\'re looking forward to. ', ' Sometimes kids avoid things that feel new or challenging. But doing new things (that are safe and right for their age) helps kids grow. With each new challenge they can gain skills and confidence.  Parents can help kids and teens face new things without letting worry hold them back. Here’s how:  Spend time with them. Do this every day, even if it\\'s just a few minutes. Do things together that you both enjoy. Go for a walk, cook, eat, play — or just hang out. Find ways to smile and laugh together. This keeps the bond between you strong and positive. And it creates moments for kids to open up naturally.  Ask what\\'s on their minds. Help kids label what they think and feel. They might not always have a lot to say. And they might not always want to talk about what\\'s on their minds. But let kids know you\\'re open to listening and talking any time.  Listen with patience. When kids and teens want to talk, listen with your full attention. Give them time to put their thoughts and feelings into words. Ask questions to hear more. Don\\'t be too quick to give advice. Let them confide. Listen calmly to what they have to say.  Validate. Let kids know you understand. Say it’s okay to feel how they feel. Tell them their feelings are normal. Try not to say, \"There\\'s nothing to worry about.\" This can make kids think they shouldn\\'t feel the way they do. Instead, listen calmly and accept how they feel. That makes it easier for kids to share.  Help kids think of how to handle things. Help them feel capable. Don\\'t jump in to solve things for them. Instead, invite kids and teens to think of what they can do. Support their good ideas. Talk it through together. Remind them of times they tried something new and it went well. Offer to help as needed.  Help them practice. When possible, help kids break a new thing into small steps. Let them practice one step at a time as they build toward their goal. Celebrate each success.  Encourage. Praise your child\\'s effort and progress. Tell them what they said or did that made you proud. Help them relax so that stress and worry don\\'t build up.  Help them expect good things. Ask your child or teen to share what\\'s going well and what they look forward to. Ask about the good things that happen in their day. Tell them about the good things in your day, too. Let them know that it’s OK to talk about worries but it helps to put more focus on the good moments.  Soothe and comfort. At times, kids and teens may feel overwhelmed by worry. In those moments, trying to talk it through isn\\'t likely to help. It might help more to offer comfort and understanding. Remind them that you\\'re there to help them through things that happen. Teach them to use calm breathing to relax their mind and body. ', \" Sometimes worries become worse with time. When kids worry too much, it’s hard to enjoy school, activities or friends. Worries can start to affect sleeping or eating. They can lead kids to feel anxious or afraid, and to avoid things they might enjoy. Worry like this could be a sign of an anxiety disorder.  If your child has worry, stress, or anxiety that seems too hard for them to handle, talk with your child's doctor or a mental health doctor. Childhood anxiety can get better with the right treatment and support. \", \" Parents  Kids  Teens  Childhood Stress: How Parents Can Help  Stress Center  Stress  Stress & Coping Center  5 Ways to Cope With Anxiety  Stress & Coping Center  Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Pinterest  About Us  Contact Us  Partners  Editorial Policy  Permissions Guidelines  Privacy Policy & Terms of Use  Notice of Nondiscrimination  Note: All information on Nemours KidsHealth is for educational purposes only.

But when a sad or bad mood lasts for weeks or longer, and when there are other changes in a child's behavior, it might be depression.  Therapy can help children who are going through sadness or depression. And there are things parents can do, too. Getting the right care can prevent things from getting worse and help a child feel better.  If sadness has lasted for weeks or longer, talk about it with your child's doctor. \", ' If a child is depressed, parents may notice some of these signs:  Sad or bad mood. A child may seem sad, lonely, unhappy, or grouchy. It can last weeks or months. A child may cry more easily. They may have more tantrums than before.  Being self-critical. Kids going through depression may complain a lot. They may say self-critical things like, \"I can\\'t do anything right.\" \"I don\\'t have any friends.\" \"I can\\'t do this.\" \"It\\'s too hard for me.\"  Lack of energy and effort. Depression can drain a child\\'s energy. They might put less effort into school than before. Even doing little tasks can feel like too much effort. Kids may seem tired, give up easily, or not try.  Not enjoying things. Kids don\\'t have as much fun with friends or enjoy playing like before. They may not feel like doing things they used to enjoy.  Sleep and eating changes. Kids may not sleep well or seem tired even if they get enough sleep. Some may not feel like eating. Others may overeat.  Aches and pains. Some children may have stomach aches or other pains. Some miss school days because of not feeling well, even though they aren\\'t sick. ', \" Different things can lead to depression. There is no single cause. Some children have genes that make them more sensitive to depression. They may have other family members who have been depressed.  Some children go through stressful things. Some have faced loss, trauma, or hardships. Some go through serious health conditions. These things can lead to sadness or grief — and sometimes to depression.  Having extra support during and after hard times helps protect children from depression or lessen the effects. But even when they have good support, some children get depressed. Therapy can help them heal, feel better, and get back to enjoying things.  Is Your Child Depressed?

Learn the signs of depression and ways to help your child feel better. \", \" The therapy for child depression is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Therapists help kids feel welcome and supported. They have kids talk about what they think and feel. They may use stories, play, lessons, or workbooks. These tools can help children feel at ease and get the most from CBT. When possible, a child's therapy includes their parent.  If a child has gone through a loss, trauma, or other difficult events, the therapy will include things that help a child heal from that, too. And if a parent is dealing with their own loss or depression, the child's therapist can help them get the care and support they need. \", \" If you think your child is depressed:  Talk with your child about sadness and depression. Kids might not know why they are so sad\\xa0and why things seem so hard. Let them know you see that they're going through a hard time and that you're there to help. Listen, comfort, offer your support, and show love.  Set up a visit with your child's doctor. Let your child's doctor know if sad or bad moods seem to go on for a few weeks. By itself, this doesn't always mean a child is depressed. Tell your child's doctor if you have also noticed changes in your child's sleep, eating, energy, or effort. Tell them if your child is dealing with a loss, a big stress, or hardship.  The doctor will do a physical exam. A full exam lets the doctor check for health issues that could cause your child's symptoms. They can also check for depression. Your child's doctor may refer you to a child therapist. The doctor's office might have a child therapist on staff.  Set up a visit with a child therapist. A child therapist (mental health doctor) will spend time talking with you and your child. They will do an in-depth check for depression by asking questions and listening. The therapist can explain how therapy can help your child.  Take your child to therapy visits. The therapist may suggest a few visits, or more. Therapy can take time, but you will see progress along the way.  Be patient and kind. When your child acts moody or difficult, try to stay patient. Talk with your child's therapist about the best ways to respond when your child acts this way. Often, it helps to connect with your child in a calm way, then guide them to better behavior. Instead of feeling bad, this lets kids feel proud of doing better. It lets them see that you're proud of them, too.  Enjoy time together. Spend time with your child doing things you both can enjoy. Go for a walk, play a game, cook, read stories, make a craft, watch a funny movie. Spend time outdoors if you can. These things gently encourage positive moods.

Stress is a normal response to changes and challenges. And life is full of those — even during childhood.  We tend to think of stress as a bad thing, caused by bad events. But upcoming good events (like graduations, holidays, or new activities) also can cause stress.  Kids and teens feel stress when there’s something they need to prepare for, adapt to, or guard against. They feel stress when something that matters to them is at stake. Change often prompts stress — even when it’s a change for the better.  Stress has a purpose. It’s a signal to get ready. ', ' In small amounts, and when kids have the right support, stress can be a positive boost. It can help kids rise to a challenge. It can help them push toward goals, focus their effort, and meet deadlines. This kind of positive stress allows kids to build the inner strengths and skills known as resilience. ', ' Stress or adversity that is too intense, serious, long-lasting, or sudden can overwhelm a child’s ability to cope. Stress can be harmful when kids don’t have a break from stress, or when they lack the support or the coping skills they need. Over time, too much stress can affect kids’ mental and physical health.  As a parent you can’t prevent your children from feeling stress. But you can help kids and teens cope. You can:  Help them use positive stress to go for goals, adapt to changes, face challenges, and gain confidence.  Give extra support and stability when they go through stressful life events.  Protect them from the harmful effects of too much stress, such as chronic stress and traumatic stress. ', \" Positive stress is the brief stress kids and teens feel when they face a challenge. It can prompt them to prepare and focus. It can motivate them to go for goals, get things done, or try new things. They might feel positive stress before a test, a big game, or a recital. When they face the challenge, the stress is over.  Positive stress gives kids the chance to grow and learn.  Here’s an example: The everyday pressure to get to school on time prompts kids to get their shoes on, gather their things, and head for the bus. But if kids don’t know how to use that positive stress, or don’t yet have the coping skills they need, it could mean a hectic race to the bus that leaves both parents and kids upset.  What parents can do:\\xa0When it comes to handling that morning school prep (or any other moment of normal stress), it's tempting to step in and get everything ready for your child. But that won’t help kids learn how to use positive stress. Instead, teach kids how to prepare without doing it for them. This takes more time and patience, but it’s worth it.  This type of positive stress can prompt kids to adapt and gain coping skills they need. It can prepare them to handle life’s bigger challenges and opportunities. \", ' Many kids and teens face difficult life events or adversity. Some get sick or need a hospital stay. Some have parents who split up. Some face the death of a loved one, move to a new neighborhood, or start a new school. Any of these life events can cause stress.  When kids face difficult life events, they might feel stress on and off for a few days or weeks as they adjust.  What parents can do: Parents can provide extra support and stability. Listen and talk with your child. Help them feel safe and loved. If possible, let them know what to expect. Talk over what will happen, what they can do to cope, and how you’ll help. Give comfort and show caring. Set up simple routines to help them feel settled. ', ' Even life events that we think of as good can be stressful. A big birthday, the first day of a school year, graduation, holidays, or travel can prompt kids and teens to feel stress.  What parents can do: Parents can help kids and teens prepare for what’s ahead. Talk them through the situation, focusing on the positive parts. Give kids a say in the plans when possible. Listen to what they think and how they feel. If they feel stressed, let them know it’s OK and they can cope. You’ll be there for them as needed. ', ' When difficult life events lead to stress that lasts for more than a few weeks, it’s called chronic stress. Chronic stress is hard on kids when they don’t have a break from it or when they don’t have the support they need or coping skills to offset the stress.  Having a serious health condition that lasts for a long time can lead to chronic stress. So can losing a parent or close family member or going through lasting adversity. Over time, stress like this can affect kids’ and teens’ mental and physical health. But there are things that can prevent the harmful effects of chronic stress.  What parents can do:  Help kids feel safe, loved, and cared for. This is the best way to offset stress. Feeling close to you and knowing you love and accept them is more important than ever. Provide routines, like the same bedtime, eating a meal together, or being there after school. Routines provide a rhythm and let kids know there are things they can count on.  Teach coping skills. Kids feel better when they know there are things they can do for themselves to offset their stress. Kids of all ages can learn and practice calm breathing and meditation. There are many other skills to learn too.  Help them take a break from stress. Make time to play, draw or paint, spend time in nature, read a book, play an instrument, be with friends and family. These activities are more than just fun. They help kids and teens feel positive emotions that offset stress. ', ' This is the stress that comes with trauma events that are serious, intense, or sudden. Traumas such as serious accidents or injuries, abuse, or violence can prompt this type of stress.  Parents can step in to protect kids when they know they are being mistreated or bullied. But it’s not always possible to protect kids from every type of trauma. If kids and teens go through traumatic stress, parents can help them get the care they need to recover.  What parents can do:  Give kids and teens extra support and care. Be there to listen and talk. Let kids know that they are safe. Validate and accept their feelings. Let them know that, with time, they will feel better.  Reach out to your child’s doctor or a therapist. Some need therapy to heal from traumatic stress. Parents can take part in the therapy and learn how to best help their child.  Spend positive time together. Encourage kids and teens to do things they enjoy. These might be things you can do together or things your teen does on their own, like enjoying music, nature, or art. These things prompt positive emotions that can offset some of the stress left over from trauma.  Give kids and teens a chance to use their strengths in everyday life. Trauma and stress can leave them feeling vulnerable, anxious, or unsure of themselves. Knowing what they can do and who they are as a person can help kids and teens feel strong and confident.

Parents spend a lot of energy on preparations, and after the baby arrives, much of the family's attention involves caring for the\\xa0newborn.  All this change can be hard for older siblings to handle. It's common for them to feel jealousy toward\\xa0the newborn and to react to the upheaval by acting out.  But parents can prepare kids for an addition to the family. Discussing the pregnancy in terms that make sense to kids, making some arrangements, and including kids in the care of the newborn can make things easier for everyone. \", ' To tell a child about an impending sibling, consider your own comfort level and your child\\'s maturity level. Preschoolers, for example, may not grasp concepts of time, so it might not mean much if you say that the baby will arrive in a few\\xa0months. It may be more useful to explain that the baby will arrive in a particular season, such as winter or when it\\'s cold outside.  How much detail should you\\xa0provide? Let your child\\'s questions be your guide. For example, a 4-year-old child may ask: \"Where do babies come from?\" Despite how it sounds, the child isn\\'t asking you to explain sex but probably wants to\\xa0know where, literally, they come from. It may be enough to explain: \"The baby comes from the uterus, which is inside the mother\\'s belly.\" A child who wants to know more will ask.  If your child shows more interest in the baby, you can encourage that by:  going through your child\\'s baby pictures  reading books about childbirth (make sure they\\'re age-appropriate)  visiting friends who have infants  packing a bag for the hospital  thinking of potential baby names  going to the doctor to hear the baby\\'s heartbeat  Also look into\\xa0sibling birth classes, which many hospitals offer to provide orientation for soon-to-be brothers and sisters. These classes can include lessons on how to hold a baby, explanations of how a baby is born, and opportunities for kids to discuss their feelings about having a new brother or sister. ', \" As your due date draws near, make arrangements for older kids for the time when you're in the hospital. Discuss these plans so kids know what to expect when the day arrives.  Consider letting your child visit you in the hospital as soon as possible after the baby is born, ideally when no other visitors are around — this helps reinforce the birth as\\xa0an intimate family event.  Try to keep routines as regular as possible in the days and weeks around the baby's arrival. If you plan to make any room shifts to accommodate the baby, do it a few weeks before your due date.  If your child is\\xa0approaching a major milestone, like potty training or moving from a crib to a bed, try to make those changes well before your due date or put them off until after the baby has been home for a while. \", ' Once the baby is home, you can help your other kids\\xa0adjust to the changes. Include them as much as possible in the daily activities involving the baby so that they don\\'t\\xa0feel left out.  Many kids want to help take care of a new\\xa0baby. Though that \"help\" may mean that each task takes longer, it can give an older child a chance to interact with the baby in a positive way. Depending on their age, a big brother or sister\\xa0may want to entertain the baby during a diaper change, help push the carriage, talk to the baby, or help dress, bathe, or burp the baby.  If your child expresses no interest in the baby, don\\'t be alarmed and don\\'t force it. It can\\xa0take time.  Some occasions, like breastfeeding, excludes older kids. For these times, try to have toys on hand so that you can feed the baby without being interrupted or worrying about an older child feeling left out.  Take advantage of chances for one-on-one time with older kids. Spend time together while the baby is sleeping and, if possible, set aside time each day for older kids\\xa0to get one parent\\'s undivided attention. Knowing that there\\'s special time just for them may help ease any resentment or anger about the new baby.  Also remind relatives and friends that your older child might want to talk about something other than the new baby. If relatives or friends ask how they can help, suggest a fun activity or something special for the older child.  Continue to send your older child to childcare or to school, if you\\'re able. It\\'s normal to feel guilty about sending your older child away since now you\\'re home with the new baby (and if you\\'re home,\\xa0you might feel that everyone should be). But keeping normal routines is helpful for siblings. And this time can give you precious one-on-one time with the baby that you might not\\xa0otherwise have. When your older child comes home from childcare or school, plan for some quality family time. ', \" With all of the changes that a new baby can bring, some older kids might struggle as they try to adjust.  Encourage older kids to talk about their feelings about the new baby. If a child cannot express those feelings, don't be surprised if he or she tests limits or reverts to speaking in baby talk.  If your child acts up, don't bend the rules, but understand what feelings may be motivating that behavior. It could be a sign that your child needs more one-on-one time with you, but make it clear that\\xa0although his or her feelings are important, they have to be expressed in appropriate ways. \", \" Parents  Sibling Rivalry  Staying Healthy During Pregnancy  Bringing Your Baby Home  Share to Facebook  Share to Twitter  Share to Pinterest  About Us  Contact Us  Partners  Editorial Policy  Permissions Guidelines  Privacy Policy & Terms of Use  Notice of Nondiscrimination  Note: All information on Nemours KidsHealth is for educational purposes only.

It affects social communication and interaction and is accompanied by repeating and narrow patterns of behavior or interests. ', ' Children with ASD often have problems with:  body language and eye contact  social interactions  building and maintaining relationships  sensory input  rigid behavior  intense and unusual interests  In toddlers, parents might notice:  delayed speech  using only a few gestures (waving, clapping, pointing)  not responding when someone calls their name  avoiding eye contact  not sharing enjoyment or interests with others  unusual ways of moving the hands, fingers, or whole body  being very focused or attached to unusual objects  little to no imitating of others or pretending  unusual sensory interests  rituals such as repeating things over and over or lining up objects  Milder symptoms may not be recognized until a child is older and has problems with:  forming friendships  pretend play  knowing how to act in different social situations  unusual, intense interests in specific topics or activities  No two people with ASD have the same signs and symptoms. Many things can play a role, such as language delays, thinking and learning problems, and behavioral challenges. For this reason, autism is described as a \"spectrum.\" ', \" Public awareness of the signs of autism and new screening tools have made early identification of autism easier. Doctors look for signs and symptoms at every checkup, ask about concerns parents may have, and do a screening test at the 18-month and 2-year visits.  If any concerns are found, doctors will suggest a complete evaluation. This usually involves a team of experts. The team may include:  medical doctors who treat developmental disorders  psychologists  occupational therapists and speech therapists  They'll observe and evaluate the child to understand his or her language/communication, thinking, emotions, development, physical health, social skills, and self-help skills. They'll also ask the family about their concerns and the child's birth, growth, development, behavior, and family history. \", \" The exact cause of ASD is unknown. It's likely that many different things in combination lead to changes in the way the brain develops before a baby is born. The strongest evidence supports the role of a person's genes.  Other things, such as problems during pregnancy or at birth, might play a role. Many children with ASD also have an intellectual disability.  Vaccines do not cause autism. \", \" The earlier treatment for kids with ASD starts, the better. Depending on a child's needs, treatment may include behavior therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, medicine, and extra help with learning. The goal is to help kids:  communicate better  play with others and learn social skills  lessen repetitive or bad behaviors  improve learning  be safe and take care of their bodies \", \" Before age 3, kids might be eligible for services through their state's early intervention program. Families work with a team of experts on an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP). This plan outlines goals and comes up with a treatment plan.  A team of therapists provides therapy at home or in daycare to eligible families.  Services may also be available in hospital-based clinics or in community centers. Insurance companies may reimburse for many services. \", \" Kids ages 3 to 5 years old with ASD who qualify are entitled to free preschool services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Therapy and/or extra learning help is offered through local school districts or other learning centers — either at home or in a classroom.  When kids reach kindergarten age, parents can ask to switch to an individualized education program (IEP) through the local school district. An IEP can include learning goals along with behavioral, social, and self-care goals. Special education services are available until a child's 21st birthday.  Hospitals, medical centers, and clinics that provide children's health services often have services for kids with ASD. Both public and private behavioral health clinics may have specific services for them. Freestanding autism centers in the community may offer some services that benefit kids with ASD.  Sometimes medicines are used to treat symptoms like aggression, hyperactivity and inattention, anxiety, depression, and sleep problems.  There isn't much research to show the benefits of many therapy approaches to ASD — such as diet changes; supplements; and music, art, and animal therapies. Tell your doctor and other team members about any other therapies you're using or considering so you can discuss the risks and possible benefits. \", ' If your child is diagnosed with ASD, many resources and support services can help.

For example, kids might lose confidence or feel like they're disappointing others. Some kids become depressed, anxious, angry, or frustrated.  When kids learn skills to manage ADHD, they do better. Therapy also helps kids feel happier and more confident. \", \" In ADHD therapy, kids learn by doing. A therapist will share activities and ideas that focus on building the skills a child or teen needs. Therapists can teach study skills, emotion skills, or attention skills, such as mindful breathing.

In ADHD therapy, a positive relationship with the therapist helps kids feel encouraged and supported as they learn.  Depending on the child's age, a therapist might meet with the child and parent together, or with the child alone.

Kids build confidence and self-esteem as they master new skills. \", \" At the beginning, your child's therapist will talk with you and ask questions. Listening to your answers helps the therapist learn more about your child. Together you will make goals for what you want to improve.  Parents and kids usually meet with the therapist once a week for a few months.  Therapy sessions include activities like:  Talking and listening. Therapists teach kids to talk about their feelings. This helps kids notice their feelings and express them in words instead of actions. Talking and listening helps kids feel understood and ready to learn. It also helps kids learn to pay attention and listen better.  Playing with a purpose. For young kids, play can teach self-control\\xa0— like waiting to take a turn. Therapists might use games that teach kids to slow down, follow directions, and try again instead of losing their temper or giving up. Play is also a way for kids to learn how to plan, organize, and put things away.  Doing activities that teach lessons. Therapists might teach lessons about emotions, organizing schoolwork, studying, or understanding others. Activities and worksheets help make these lessons fun.  Practicing new skills. A therapist might teach kids skills like mindfulness and breathing exercises. These skills can train attention and calm the mind and body. Therapy sessions can be a time to practice these skills.  Problem solving. Therapists will ask about ADHD problems in school and at home. They will talk together with kids and parents about how to work out these problems. \", ' How long therapy lasts will depend on your goals.

And in the strange, circular thought process of motherhood, I’ve inevitably brought it back to my kids: how can I be sure they aren’t the victims of bullying? Would they step in for someone who was being bullied? Have I taught them how important it is not to be a bully? What would it be like if they could live in a society without bullies or mean girls or trolls? What if the hurting and anxious and depressed among us were more often met with kindness than cruelty? How might that impact the world around us?  I’m not a psychologist. As an intensivist, I tend to see the tragic end result of things rather than their more subtle or insidious beginnings. In fact, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of my hopes for a silver lining was that when people saw the intensive care unit up close and unwelcome, they would begin to take more seriously the self-care steps needed to keep themselves out of one if they could. It hasn’t exactly turned out that way, but I haven’t completely given up hope yet. So, in that spirit, here is what I’ve found out about helping your kid become a positive force against the destructive effects of bullying. ', ' Kids need to understand that they have the power to stand up for themselves and others – to ensure that neither their physical nor their emotional safety is threatened. What they need in order to do that effectively – without escalating the conflict in counterproductive ways – is a tool kit that works for them. This will differ for each kid, and it’s best to talk through strategies that feel like a good fit for their personality in advance or at the first sign that something might be developing. It might be as simple as responding to a bully with a firm “Stop it” or “That’s not cool” and walking away (with the bullied kid, if your kid is stepping in to defend them). Maybe your kid is good at using humor to change the tone of a situation, or changing the subject, or creating a distraction (“Hey, is that our teacher over there?”). Maybe your kid is willing to just stand beside the bullied kid to show them they aren’t alone. Perhaps they missed a chance at the moment. But it’s not too late to reach out to the bullied kid and let them know you saw what happened and they didn’t deserve it. And of course, kids should know how to get a responsible adult involved to stop the bullying behavior. This might be especially important for a kid who observed the bullying rather than experienced it directly since bullied kids are very often made to feel that the bullying will only get worse if they tell someone. Practice makes perfect, so you may want to run through the tools with your kid a few times before expecting them to put them into use. ', ' This might be the least discussed but clearly the most effective way to eliminate bullying from our kids’ lives. If every kid knew not to be a bully, there wouldn’t be a need to stand up for bullied kids. Again, with the undying hopes! Here’s my approach to this issue for my kids. First, we know that many kids are bullied or made to feel powerless in their own lives before they ever become bullies themselves. So, we try to avoid arbitrary exertions of parental power – good rules have reasons – and we try to emphasize good character at least as much as we do childhood accomplishments. An act of kindness or sympathy is noted and praised as much as a great report card or a home run. We talk a lot about boundaries – about how everyone gets to make decisions about their bodies ranging from the right not to be hit or kicked to the right to choose not to give a hug or be tickled. We try to teach that we are better for our differences than if we were all exactly alike. And we try to help our kids imagine themselves in someone else’s shoes (“How do you think you would feel if…?”). Most importantly, we try to role model kindness and respect in our own lives and words. We know that our example speaks louder to them than anything we say.  There is a lot of other information out there and from people far more qualified than me to give advice. My hope today is to re-emphasize how important this issue is and give you a starting point for dealing with it for your kids.

Toilet training is daunting – as probably every one of the more than 7000 toilet training-related books on Amazon will tell you.\\xa0 Those 7000 books are also a clue that there are lots of different methods or suggestions for doing it the “right” or “best” way.\\xa0 Thankfully, I believe there are a few simple principles that can help sort it all out: ', ' Toilet training is something that a typically developing child must achieve at some point in order to meet cultural expectations for personal hygiene and participation in his or her broader society.\\xa0 In other words, children who fail to toilet train may be subject to social embarrassment and exclusion and will be unable to attend school or participate in extracurricular activities.\\xa0 As a parent, then, you have two main goals: (1) facilitate your child’s success in toilet training in a timeframe that helps him/her to continue his/her social development and expected educational trajectory, and (2) do so in a way that does not produce feelings of shame, guilt, and anxiety in your child.\\xa0 Looking for a third goal? (3) Don’t torture yourself in the process. ', ' The first step is to assess your child’s readiness for toilet training.\\xa0 Developmental readiness encompasses the ability to sense the need to pee or poop, the ability to communicate that sensation to a caregiver, the ability to sit steadily on the toilet seat – whether a toddler’s potty chair or modification of the regular toilet – and to devote his or her attention to the task at hand for a sufficient period of time.\\xa0 Some experts recommend the ability to pull his or her pants up and down, but initially your child will be accompanied to the toilet 100% of the time, and I consider this less necessary than the other requirements.\\xa0 In addition to this, your child should display interest in using the potty and a desire to be “clean” or be rid of diapers.\\xa0 Children display interest in a variety of ways, including following parents into the bathroom, asking questions, making observations and reporting when the diaper needs changing.\\xa0 Even after these signs appear, it may take weeks or months for the child to progress from curiosity to toilet training action, and it is important for the parent to be attuned to the child’s interest and open to his or her questions.\\xa0 It is helpful for parents to agree on what they consider to be appropriate terminology within the household for these bodily functions and to be consistent in their use in order to avoid creating confusion for the child.  When thinking about your timeline for toilet training, it is important to approach your child as an individual who is just trying to master a task.\\xa0 There is no evidence that the timing of toilet training has any association with intelligence or future success in life.\\xa0 My very bright, socially adept son may have been the last in his daycare class to complete toilet training (I’m not actually sure, since I made a conscious decision not to create comparisons), but he was within the same general timeline, completely within reported age norms, and well before he needed to enter the diaper-free zone known as preschool.\\xa0 Your child will eventually perceive the need to conform to this social expectation, and the process will be completed more quickly and painlessly on his/her timeline than on an imposed one.\\xa0 There is currently no evidence to support the idea that offering a reward – other than the intrinsic rewards of being “more grown up” and being rid of diapers – will create the necessary motivation to complete toilet training.\\xa0 Positive reinforcement even for small attempts at progress is encouraged – go ahead and be very liberal with your praise.\\xa0 Most importantly, discipline or shaming has no place in a successful toilet training process and is more likely to prolong or delay it.\\xa0 Negative comparisons to other children’s progress should be avoided, and once training is underway, the inevitable accidents should be met with a matter-of-fact change of clothing and an “It’s OK – we’ll get it the next time!”\\xa0 Frequent accidents are generally an indication that the child is not quite ready, and at that point you should resume the use of diapers until the child expresses interest in trying again.\\xa0 Remember, too, that nighttime dryness is generally achieved somewhat later than daytime dryness, and your child may require a diaper or “pull up” at night for some time after daytime toilet training is achieved.  In the service of not torturing yourself, it is fully acceptable to avoid toilet training methods that you feel will only aggravate you.\\xa0 Other parents have told me that they used the often-touted method of allowing their child to run around the house completely in the nude for a weekend, whisking him or her off to the toilet whenever it appeared that he or she needed to go or had commenced going.\\xa0 This worked for them, and kudos to them.\\xa0 The neat freak in me cannot even contemplate this slightly feral situation without horror, and I quickly eliminated it from the list of tools I might consider.\\xa0 Likewise, my children have shown more interest in the actual potty than in the potty chair, and I am more than happy not to have an Elmo-shaped chamber pot to empty and clean.\\xa0 Providing timed “opportunities” for success did make sense to me, however, and I frequently offered a trial of sitting on the potty around bath time and before bedtime.\\xa0 It may take some trial and error, but with patience and an intact sense of humor, you will find what works for you and your child. ', ' You have more help at hand than you might think.\\xa0 Talk to other parents who have successfully toilet trained at least one child (the more the better); I’m frequently amazed at the ingenuity of the people in my life, and you might be amazed at the genius idea your best friend came up with.\\xa0 If your child attends daycare or has other caregivers when you are away from home, enlist their ideas and experience, and check in with them to see if you are being consistent and if they perceive that things are generally on track.\\xa0 Work with them to make incremental progress where you can and try to implement any daytime routines through the weekends when possible.\\xa0 Remember that your parents and your significant other’s parents somehow managed to toilet train you and your significant other, and they could have special insights into what might work for your child – or what might not work particularly well.\\xa0 And don’t forget that you can make use of the vast expertise of your pediatrician and his/her staff, many of whom have implemented electronic forms of communication for non-urgent issues and guidance.  I can’t promise that toilet training will be easy.\\xa0 But I can promise it will be successful…eventually.\\xa0 Good luck! ', \" So what's all this talk about measles, anyway?

Encopresis is generally defined as the passage of feces in inappropriate places, like underwear or the floor, by children who are past the age of toilet training. A variety of different factors can contribute to encopresis, including both physical and behavioral factors. This is why it is essential to involve both medical and behavioral health clinicians in the treatment of encopresis.  One common physical contributing factor for encopresis is constipation, which may lead to overflow bowel incontinence (stool leakage).  Behavioral factors can also contribute to constipation, and in turn encopresis. These include ignoring physical cues associated with passing stool as well as voluntary withholding of bowels. For example, a child may have had a particularly painful bowel movement. Then the child may voluntarily withhold their stool for fear of experiencing pain.  Although constipation may contribute to encopresis, it is important to note that not all children with encopresis will have constipation. ', ' First, it’s important for the family to work closely with a medical provider to identify any medical reason for encopresis, such as constipation. The provider can then implement a bowel cleanout if appropriate.  If a bowel cleanout is appropriate, it is important this occurs prior to the implementation of behavioral techniques. Once the child has completed the bowel cleanout, the following interventions may be helpful:  Increase your child’s awareness of their physical cues associated with passing stool. Parents may need to point out to their children when they are demonstrating physical signs that they need to use the restroom like “the potty dance.”  Implement scheduled sitting – regular times each day that the child will sit on the toilet. To encourage sitting on the toilet, parents can give the child a special toy or electronic device that can only be used on the toilet.  Parents should provide praise for sitting on the toilet regardless of whether or not the child passed a bowel movement while sitting. For example, “I like how you sat on the toilet,” or “I’m really glad that you tried.”  Encourage your child to implement deep breathing to help them relax on the toilet.  If your child has an accident in between scheduled sitting times, remain calm and encourage your child to clean up.  Implementing a reward system may also be helpful.  If interested in receiving support from a behavioral health specialist in terms of implementation of behavioral interventions, please contact your pediatrician or call 454-TEEN (8336) for referrals.

Nightmares are described as frightening dreams that may awaken a child. Nightmares in children usually occur during the second half of the night when dreaming is at its peak. Upon waking, kids may be afraid to return to sleep and may seek comfort. Risk factors that may increase the likelihood that children will experience a nightmare include increased stress or anxiety and general lack of sleep.  Nightmares are a part of normal cognitive development. However, they can be distressing for both parent and child. What can you do as a parent to address nightmares?  Implement a consistent sleep schedule in order to ensure adequate sleep  Avoid scary movies or television shows, especially prior to bedtime  When a nightmare occurs, go to your child to provide reassurance and remind the child “it was only a dream”  Allow the child to use a dim night light  Introduce a comfort object (e.g. teddy bear, blanket, etc.)  Encourage your child to try relaxation strategies such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation (please see childanxiety.net for additional information)  Provide an explanation regarding what nightmares are during the daytime, as discussing this topic at night may increase anxiety  Read children’s books about nighttime fears in order to increase your child’s understanding of fears  If nightmares continue to persist, contact your pediatrician or local behavioral health specialist for additional assistance!

Before starting the process, it’s important to make sure your child is developmentally ready.

Though alarming to many parents, about 20 percent of school-age children develop tics at some point. However, less than 3 percent of them display those tics for more than a year. If tics persist for more than 12 months, you may hear the diagnosis “Persistent Tic Disorder.” If all of the tics are movements, we make the diagnosis “Persistent Motor Tic Disorder.” If all of the tics are vocalizations, we call it “Persistent Vocal Tic Disorder.” If both motor and vocal tics persist for more than a year, that defines “Tourette Syndrome.”  Tics typically become apparent at age 6-7 years and peak around 10-12 years. Somewhere between 50-80 percent of children with persistent tics will see them dissipate or disappear before adulthood. ', ' For most, the unwanted sounds and movements are no more than a nuisance. One of the most important messages I emphasize is that if the person experiencing the tics is not bothered by them, then others should not be bothered, either. Of course, there are some exceptions to that rule. If the tic is, or has the potential to be, self-injurious, or is socially inappropriate, then it needs to be treated, but that only occurs in about 10 percent of patients.  Most children with a persistent tic disorder have at least one co-occurring problem, a so-called “comorbidity.” The most common comorbidities are ADHD, OCD, and anxiety. Accordingly, children with tic disorders need to be assessed for these comorbidities and receive education regarding the potential for these conditions to emerge.  While environmental factors and illness may influence ticcing, the weight of evidence argues that tic disorders and their comorbidities are inherited/genetic. The inheritance pattern can be subtle and unexpected. In the clinic, we often see a parent, while either indicating that they experienced childhood tics that remitted or that no one in the immediate family ever had tics, demonstrating frequent subtle tics. ', ' The majority of children with tics do not need any therapy. Many children and families benefit from education, de-stigmatization, and the bolstering of coping strategies. The adults in that child’s life need to learn how to support the child without insisting on medication or suppressing the tics. Asking a person with tics to actively suppress them is like asking a person with seasonal allergies to not sneeze–it is unfair and unrealistic. If that child also has ADHD and/or anxiety, the request to suppress taxes an already challenged attention system and/or produces additional anxiety.  Roughly a dozen different medications have strong clinical trial evidence for reducing tics. In addition, a behavioral therapy called Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) has been subjected to rigorous clinical trial demands and is as effective as any medication for tics. CBIT is a great tool because it teaches children how to eliminate the most burdensome tic. Medications are not as “smart” and are intended to help with ticcing, per se. To reiterate, though, only a fraction of patients with tics require any therapy, whether medication, behavioral or both.

Parents often ask me, “Is ADHD overdiagnosed?” That’s a tough question to answer. Many factors affect a child’s attention, making ADHD a complicated diagnosis. We follow standards and strict procedures to assess symptoms of ADHD and accurately diagnose the condition. If you see signs your child Is struggling in school or other aspects of life because of attention, talk to a trusted physician.  When you talk to your pediatrician, it is likely they will recommend involving the school and obtaining classroom assessments. Historically, ADHD has been more commonly diagnosed in boys, largely because boys often present disruptive behaviors that are easy to identify in the classroom. The inattentive type of ADHD is harder to identify in both boys and girls. In these circumstances, the child is more of a daydreamer who is missing concepts in the classroom because he or she is focused on something else.  Many parents are conflicted about whether or not to give their child medication to treat ADHD. Medication is a very personal decision, and there are a few natural remedies you can try before pursuing other options. These include:  Changing diet by avoiding food dyes and preservatives  Addressing sleep issues  While natural remedies for children with ADHD can help, they do not always work. When deciding whether to try ADHD medications, remember: these medicines have been used for over 50 years. When used correctly, they are very safe and effective.  If you suspect your child is displaying signs and symptoms of ADHD, talk to your pediatrician. If you have additional concerns, they can help you decide when it’s time to connect with a specialist who works with more complicated cases.

Parents can take steps to prepare their children for school and ease them through the transition.  For some children, waiting an extra year before starting kindergarten can help.  Many preschoolers with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — or symptoms of it — are much less likely than their peers to be ready for school, a study in Pediatrics found.  Experts say, though, that’s no reason to stop the child from entering kindergarten.  A team led by Dr. Irene Loe, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford University, found 79 percent of children with ADHD weren’t at full readiness compared to 13 percent of children without the disorder.  “A lot of these kids are not identified until they’re really having a lot of trouble in the school setting,” Loe said in a statement.  She studied 93 children ages 4 and 5 — most who attended or had attended preschool, some who were enrolled in kindergarten. Of them, 45 were diagnosed with ADHD or identified by parents as having symptoms, 48 of the children didn’t have ADHD.  The researchers confirmed they were properly classified. They looked at five areas of functioning: physical well-being and motor development; social and emotional development; approaches to learning; language development; and cognition and general knowledge.  Children were deemed to be impaired if scores in one area were more than one standard deviation worse than the mean score for their age. They were considered unready for school if they were impaired in two or more of the five areas. ', ' Kids who had ADHD were no more likely than their peers to struggle with cognition and general knowledge. They were more likely than children without the disorder to have difficulty in the other four areas.  They were:  73 times more likely to struggle in approaches to learning  more than 7 times as likely to have impaired social and emotional development  6 times as likely to have trouble with language development  3 times as likely to have impaired physical well-being and motor development  Families need access to behavioral therapy for preschoolers with ADHD — something recommended for the age group but not always covered by insurance.  “If a child has solid preacademic skills (they don’t need to be reading and writing yet) and plays with same-age friends, they are going to be more engaged in kindergarten than preschool. That’s true even if they have ADHD,” said Dr. Mark Bertin, a developmental pediatrician from New York. ', ' Parents whose children aren’t yet in school can seek help from a psychologist, pediatrician, or developmental pediatrician, Bertin said.  Preparing children for school usually starts prior to entering kindergarten, as some children have speech delays or autistic spectrum disorders, added Dr. Marc Lerner, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine.  Part B special services, which provides services for toddlers, can start at age 3. ', ' Many children with ADHD may also experience high levels of worry, so being able to get comfortable on campus or with peers before school starts can be helpful.  Another way to prepare children is to ensure regular schedules and good sleep habits. Parents can also mimic a child’s upcoming school schedule the month before school begins in order to help prepare the child.  Growing their social-emotional competence is critical to learning for all children headed to school. It can be quite valuable for children with ADHD symptoms, Lerner said.  Parents should encourage developmental skills that can aid in school success such as physical health, sensory development, behavioral management, being able to focus, sharing, communicating emotions, coping with emotions, and early academic skills. ', ' Some parents consider waiting a year to let a child with ADHD enter kindergarten, but there’s not much evidence that it’s useful for most students, Bertin said.  The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests only doing so around kindergarten or first grade, or at a time of a natural transition such as family relocation.  Bertin said holding a child back doesn’t help in the short run. When their disorder is manageable, the child may then be less academically engaged.  “Holding someone back also can disrupt educational services, and can affect self-esteem,” he said.  Lerner concurred.  “Parents… may believe they are giving them a better chance to succeed in academics, athletics, or social settings… this isn’t necessarily the case,” Lerner said. “Labeling children as ‘not ready’ for kindergarten and delaying the start of school can prevent them from being in a more appropriate learning environment.”  Some evidence suggests that being among the youngest in a class can cause academic problems, but most issues seem to disappear by the third or fourth grade, Lerner explained.  Other research indicates that children who are old for their grade are at a greater risk for behavioral problems during adolescence, possibly because they aren’t challenged and become bored. ', ' The AAP released a report this month calling for kindergarten screening, rather than a gatekeeping test, for age-eligible children to enter school.  School readiness skills in most young children have improved, but achievement gaps based on poverty, race, and early trauma still exist.  The AAP found that 48 percent of low-income children are ready for school at 5 years old, compared to 75 percent of children of the same age who came from moderate- or high-income households.  Kids who’ve experienced two or more key traumatic events (abuse, neglect, seeing violence, or being separated from a parent due to death, incarceration, or divorce) are 2.67 times more likely to repeat a grade than peers who didn’t have adverse experiences.  “It’s not just about preacademic skills,” said Dr. P. Gail Williams, lead author. “It’s a combination of physical well-being, social emotional abilities, being able to self-regulate, as well as language skills and cognitive skills. And that starts right from birth.” ', ' Our experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.

I don’t think so.”  “Okay, well if all is well, we’ll see you in 3 months.”  “Great,” I said, strapping my screaming, freshly vaccinated son into his stroller. “Oh actually, there is one thing. Should Hunter be sleeping through the night?”  “He’s not?” she asked.  “No,” I chuckled. “Not him. Never him”  You see, my son — my 13-month-old son — isn’t (and has never been) a good sleeper. I mean, he naps well, and rests often. He dozes in his Bumbo seat and car seat. He regularly falls asleep on me, in his stroller, and at the dinner table, but in the evening, he is restless.  I put him down at 7:30 p.m. He wakes at 10:30 p.m. and it’s a struggle to get him back to sleep. On a good day, he stays asleep until 5 a.m.  Most days he is up by 4 a.m.  And while I’ve tried to get him to sleep in and (more importantly) sleep through the night — I’ve adjusted his diet, bedtime, and the length of his naps — nothing works.  Not more sleep. Not less sleep. Not salves, scents, oils, or the dreaded “cry it out.” And that is because it is normal for babies to be sleepless and restless. ', ' Now I know what you’re thinking: You’re saying, “She’s rationalizing. She’s making excuses.” I can hear you saying, “She’s wrong.” And that’s because I’ve heard it all.  Well-meaning friends have told me stories of their blissfully sleeping babes. Of infants who began sleeping through the night by their 16th week or, in some cases, their 12th.  Moms on social media have inundated me with sleep training tips and suggestions. Strangers have told me what I am doing right… and wrong.  And even though no one agrees on the solution, everyone agrees my son is an anomaly.  Something, they say, is wrong.  But the truth is babies do wake up.  A 2019 study found that as babies passed the 6-month mark it wasn’t that they were waking fewer times each night — it was that they weren’t waking their parents as often.  It has been firmly established that sleep cycles exist, and adults experience brief periods of wakefulness each night, so why do we expect different from our littlest ones?  Further, a 2018 study showed that 57 percent of 6-month-olds were not “sleeping through the night” for 8 hours. Older babies weren’t getting a full night’s shut-eye either. Researchers found that 43 percent of 12-month-olds woke up in the middle of the night.  So for every parent who claims their little one slept through the night at just a few weeks old, there are plenty who are still waking with their babies at 6 months, 12 months, and beyond.  Newborns need to wake for frequent feedings. Infants are still learning to experience the world and aren’t fully equipped to self-soothe. Even toddlers who wake early or in the middle of the night are developmentally normal.  Babies also don’t wear clocks or read calendars, so while many books and articles suggest your infant will sleep through the night by a certain date, there’s no guarantee.  Every baby is different. What works for one baby will not work for every baby. ', ' Absolutely.  You can and should create a routine. Bath. Clean diaper. Pajamas. Feeding. Bed.  You can and should try to stick to a schedule. Some experts suggest putting your child to bed at a particular time, like 6 or 6:30 p.m., but the hour doesn’t matter as much as the habit. Consistency is key.  And you can (and should) create a space which encourages sleep. Put your baby in a dark, cool, quiet room.  You can also try various tools, for example, some babies love to be swaddled during those first months. Other parents swear by sound machines.  But my son didn’t care for any of these things. He wouldn’t use a pacifier. He hated white noise. And even the most high-end swaddles we tried when he was a newborn didn’t soothe him to sleep, and that’s OK.  It is normal. He is OK. Your baby is OK.  So while you may be tired — I know I am — please be kind to yourself. Be patient with yourself and realize that having a sleepless child doesn’t make you an inept person — or a bad parent. Really.  You’re doing a great job, and your baby is doing just fine. Some children just march to the beat of a different drum. Besides, one day your child will be a teenager, and I assure you that (by then) your little one will love sleep.

A recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology suggests that a child’s self-esteem is already established by age five and is comparable in strength to that of adults. Children with high self-esteem generally become more successful in life.  Unfortunately, the outcomes for children with low self-esteem can be quite poor. As a parent, your child’s self-esteem is primarily your responsibility. You can do a lot to help your child feel confident and competent.  Children with high self-esteem have the confidence to try new activities and feel a sense of pride in their accomplishments. While it’s never pleasant to fail, these kids possess the emotional ability to withstand the lack of success and maintain the courage to try again. Children with low self-esteem are self-critical and have difficulty being positive when making mistakes, which may make them unable to try again or refuse the next opportunity to succeed.  Children can be sensitive and have a peer group that can be harsh, so as a parent, what you do at home matters tremendously. Your child’s healthy self-esteem will also serve as a buffer to survive the unpleasantness of other kids.  Give your child the best chance to thrive and be happy. Use the following strategies to help them feel good about themselves:  1. Love your child unconditionally. Every child should believe that no matter what they do—success or failure—their parents still love them and will continue to be there for them. Consider the impact on a child’s self-esteem when they believe they’re only loved when they behave a certain way or achieve a specific result.  2. Spend quality time. Spending one-on-one time with your kids has more to do with ordinary daily life than what you might initially expect. It’s simple and meaningful interactions, such as bedtime stories and family dinners, that are essential for your child’s development and future relationships. Try to carve out time to connect with your child daily.  3. Help to set achievable goals. Few things are more beneficial to self-esteem than success. Work with your child to establish these goals. Begin with goals that are easy to accomplish to provide them with a taste of success and the confidence boost that goes along with it. For example, an achievable goal for a young child might be to pick up their toys and put them away.  4. Encourage persistence. Success and persistence go hand-in-hand. Encourage your child to be persistent, and you are showing them how to be successful. Praise them when they stick to a difficult task and don’t give up. One way you can help your kids is to set a good example. Demonstrate what it means to persevere and to have a positive attitude.  5. Give your child choices.When you don’t have control over your life, it’s hard to have self-esteem. Give your child choices to provide a sense of self-control and encourage their ability to trust their own judgment. This can be as simple as giving them two options for lunch or choosing what outfit they wear to school, even if it’s a little mismatched.  6. Discourage perfection. Discourage your child from attempting to be perfect—a game no one can win. Your child’s self-esteem will suffer when they realize they can never be perfect. Show them that you value effort and progress. These are actions that anyone can achieve.  7. Avoid over-praising. Your child knows when your praise is excessive. In fact, excessive praise has been shown over time to hurt a child’s confidence rather than boost it. Give credit when recognition is due. Praise your child for making a reasonable effort, and be as specific as possible versus speaking in general terms. For example, instead of saying, “That painting looks beautiful!” say something like, “I love the way you used so many different colors!”  8. Allow your child to overhear you complimenting them. A child gets a significant boost in their self-esteem when they hear a parent praising them to another adult. Your kids are always watching you. Use that to your advantage whenever possible.  9. Take good care of yourself. Taking proper care of yourself shows your kids that you’re important and value yourself. They will believe they’re important and should also take care of themselves. You can model to your child how to make themselves a priority.  There’s no doubt that a child with high self-esteem is happier and more confident. We want the best for our children, so our responsibility is to help lead them down this path.  What we do at home can significantly impact our children’s future. Teach your children to love, value, and believe in themselves, and they’ll reap the benefits throughout their lives.

Communication is essential and communicating with a child who has attention or sensory challenges can be difficult. Below are strategies for strengthening communication with your child.  Recognize when your child is actually hearing you and paying attention.Most people require eye contact to know that they’re being heard. However, a child with ADD or ADHD has a mind that is operating at a fast pace. They may not be able to make or maintain eye contact with you. This doesn’t mean that they’re not listening. On the contrary, many children fidget with objects when they’re listening. Pay attention to your child’s cues.  Give them short and simple directions.Children are easily overwhelmed. When you’re teaching them something or asking them to perform a task, give them step-by-step instructions. However, don’t lay out all the steps at once. Give them one or two simple steps and then move on once each step is completed.  Create communication strategies.You may need to get creative when trying to communicate with your child. For example, introduce a ‘listening ball.’ Instruct your child to hold the ball or toss it from hand to hand while they listen to you. You can also use visual cues to indicate what you want or need your child to do. When it’s time for bed, show them a picture of a bed or give them the stuffed animal that they sleep with.  Give them choices.Children learn to quickly tune their parents out, especially when they perceive that you’re talking at them rather than to them. However, when you give your child a choice, it’s easier for them to listen. They often allow themselves to slow down and weigh the choices so that they can make the most appealing decision. For example, when it’s time for bed you might say, “It’s time for bed. Which pajamas do you want to wear tonight – the red ones or the blue ones?”  Related: Parenting Your ADHD Child – Strategies That Work!  Use visual aids.Children with ADD and ADHD respond to visual aids. Instead of telling them what they need to do to get ready for bed, create a poster with a series of pictures demonstrating the steps.  Talk softly and remain calm.As you become agitated or raise your voice, it can stimulate your child. This is the opposite of what you’re trying to accomplish, especially if they’re already agitated or upset. Speak quietly to your child and remain calm. If they’re throwing a tantrum or are agitated, step away and engage in a quiet activity that they may find interesting. Build a tower with blocks, color, or work on a puzzle. Your calm can and will influence them.  Explain your expectations.When your child knows what is expected of them and what they can expect, they tend to behave better. Rewarding positive behavior also supports future cooperation.  Raising a child with ADD or ADHD requires some creative parenting. Learn your child’s cues and triggers. Observe their learning style and support that style in your communication. If you’re struggling, join a support group. Sometimes talking to other parents can help you not only cope but you can also pick up some new tips.

Some babies become hysterical when mom is out of sight for a very short time, while other children seem to demonstrate ongoing anxiety at separations during infancy, toddlerhood, and preschool. ', ' The trick for surviving separation anxiety demands \\r preparation, brisk transitions, and the evolution of time. I would suggest we parents suffer as much as our children do when we \\r leave. Even though we are often reminded that our children stop crying within minutes of our leave-taking, how many of you have felt like you’re \"doing it all wrong\" when your child clings to your legs, sobs for you to stay, and mourns the parting?  As a \\r working parent, separation anxiety creates questions for me. Although it is an entirely normal behavior and a beautiful sign of a meaningful attachment, separation anxiety can be exquisitely unsettling for us all.  Here are facts about separation anxiety and tips to improve the transitions I’ve learned the hard way \\r (I’ve made about every mistake): ', ' Infants: Separation anxiety develops after a child gains an understanding of object permanence. Once your infant realizes you’re really gone (when you are), it may leave them unsettled. Although some babies display object permanence and separation anxiety as early as 4 to 5 months of age, most develop more robust separation anxiety at around 9 months. The leave- taking can be worse if your infant is hungry, tired, or not feeling well. Keep transitions short and routine if it’s a tough day.

Toddlers: Many toddlers skip separation anxiety in infancy and start demonstrating challenges at 15 or 18 months of age. Separations are more difficult when children are hungry, tired, or sick—which is most of toddlerhood! As children develop independence during toddlerhood, they may become even more aware of separations. Their behaviors at separations will be loud, tearful, and difficult to stop.

It doesn’t mean they aren’t stressed, but they certainly are vying for a change. Be consistent; don’t return to the room based on a child’s plea, and certainly don’t cancel plans based on separation anxiety.

When an ASD is the reason for language delays, your child will also have difficulty interacting with other people and may show some or all of the concerning behaviors listed previously. If there is concern your child might have an ASD, your child will usually be referred to a specialist or a team of specialists for evaluation and treatment of an ASD or a related disorder.

If your child wets the bed, they are not alone.  Although most children are toilet trained between 2 and 4 years of age, some children may not be able to stay dry at night until they are older. Children develop at their own rate. For example, studies have shown that 15% of 5- and 7-year-olds wet the bed. But by age 15, fewer than 1%wet the bed.  Bedwetting is not a serious medical condition, but it can be a challenging problem for children and parents. Read on to find out more about bedwetting and what\\xa0families can do about it.

Rarely, some children begin to wet the bed as a result of a serious medical problem. \", \" Most children wet their beds during toilet training. Even after they stay dry at night for a number of days or even weeks, they may start wetting at night again. If this happens to your child, simply go back to training pants at night and try again another time. The problem usually disappears as children get older. If children reach school age and still have problems wetting the bed, it most likely means they have never developed nighttime bladder control.

Behaviors such as defecating (pooping) in a corner of the bedroom, having daily accidents at school after many months of complete dryness, or pleading to return to diapers are disturbing and even frightening to many parents—more so when they do not understand the cause.  Once physical causes have been ruled out, however, the reasons behind many of these behaviors can be unearthed by considering any changes in your child’s life or emotional development, observing thier other behaviors and listening carefully to what they say. ', \" A major change in a child's life can cause them to regress during toilet training. Regression can occur for similar reasons long after toilet training. A new baby in the family, a move to a new home, family conflict, or any other emotionally stressful situation may cause your child to revert to an earlier level of bathroom mastery. This may involve \\r bedwetting, puddling, withholding of stool and even pooping in inappropriate places. Inner stress prompted by your child’s normal development can affect her bathroom behaviors as well. \", ' Other feelings and emotional situations can overwhelm your young child and cause them to behave in ways that seem puzzling at first. A desire for more attention may cause them to stage more accidents just to engage you in conversation or emotional interaction. If they feel you have been too controlling about bathroom use—constantly asking if they need to go instead of letting them direct their own behavior—they may resist going until it’s too late and they have an accident instead.  A more active imagination and a tendency toward magical thinking may cause them to fear the toilet and start to avoid it. Even a desire to befriend another child by imitating them can lead to regressive bathroom behavior if the other child is not toilet-trained. Finally, a temporary wish to return to coddled babyhood, which nearly all young children experience at some time, may prompt your child to ask you if they can start wearing diapers again. ', ' For toilet-trained children, as well as for those still being trained, regression in bathroom use usually does not last long. Respond calmly and use it as an opportunity to support and communicate with your child. Help your child identify the problem, sympathize with their feelings, and help them find practical solutions. Such evidence of your support and understanding will help her to relax and eventually move forward.  Meanwhile, try to avoid major concessions such as returning to diapers. Instead, consider offering to put them in training pants under their underwear for a while, put the potty in their room, accompany them to the preschool bathroom before the school day begins, or otherwise compromise until they feel more secure.

As they create these friendships, children discover that they, too, each have special qualities that make them likable—a revelation that gives a vital boost to self-esteem.  There's some more good news about your child's development at this age: As they become more aware of and sensitive to the feelings and actions of others, they'll gradually stop competing and will learn to cooperate when playing with her friends. They take turns and share toys in small groups, though sometimes they won't. But instead of grabbing, whining, or screaming for something, they'll actually ask politely much of the time. You can look forward to less aggressive behavior and calmer play sessions. Three-year-olds are able to work out solutions to disputes by taking turns or trading toys. \", ' However, particularly in the beginning, you\\'ll need to encourage this cooperation. For instance, you might suggest that they \"use their words\" to deal with problems instead of acting out. Also, remind them that when two children are sharing a toy, each gets an equal turn. Suggest ways to reach a simple solution when your child and another child want the same toy, such as drawing for the first turn or finding another toy or activity. This doesn\\'t work all the time, but it\\'s worth a try. Also, help children with the appropriate words to describe their feelings and desires so that they don\\'t feel frustrated. Above all, show by your own example how to cope peacefully with conflicts. If you have an explosive temper, try to tone down your reactions in their presence. Otherwise, they\\'ll mimic your behavior whenever they\\'re under stress. ', \" No matter what you do, however, there probably will be times when your child's anger or frustration becomes physical. When that happens, restrain them from hurting others, and if they don't calm down quickly, move them away from the other children. Talk to them about her feelings and try to determine why they're so upset. Let them know you understand and accept her feelings, but make it clear that physically attacking another child is not a good way to express these emotions. \", ' Help them see the situation from the other child\\'s point of view by reminding them of a time when someone hit or screamed at them, and then suggest more peaceful ways to resolve their conflicts. Finally, once they understand what they\\'ve done wrong—but not before—ask them to apologize to the other child. However, simply saying \"I\\'m sorry\" may not help your child correct their behavior; they also needs to know why they\\'re apologizing. They may not understand right away, but give it time; by age four these explanations will begin to mean something. ', \" Fortunately, the normal interests of three-year-olds keep fights to a minimum. They spend much of their playtime in fantasy activity, which tends to be more cooperative than play that's focused on toys or games. As you've probably already seen, preschooler enjoy assigning different roles in an elaborate game of make-believe using imaginary or household objects. This type of play helps develop important social skills, such as taking turns, paying attention, communicating (through actions and expressions as well as words), and responding to one another's actions. And there's still another benefit: Because pretend play allows children to slip into any role they wish—including superheroes or the fairy godmother—it also helps them explore more complex social ideas. Plus it helps improve executive functioning such as problem-solving  By watching the role-playing in your child's make-believe games, you may see that they're beginning to identify their own gender and gender identity. While playing house, boys naturally will adopt the father's role and girls the mother's, reflecting whatever they've noticed in the hemworld around them. \", \" Research shows that a few of the developmental and behavioral differences that typically distinguish boys from girls are biologically determined. Most gender-related characteristics at this age are more likely to be shaped by culture and family. Your daughter, for example, may be encouraged to play with dolls by advertisements, gifts from well-meaning relatives, and the approving comments of adults and other children. Boys, meanwhile, may be guided away from dolls in favor of more rough-and-tumble games and sports. Children sense the approval and disapproval and adjust their behavior accordingly. Thus, by the time they enter kindergarten, children's gender identities are often well established.  As children start to think in categories, they often understand the boundaries of these labels without understanding that boundaries can be flexible; children this age often will take this identification process to an extreme. Girls may insist on wearing dresses, nail polish, and makeup to school or to the playground. Boys may swagger, be overly assertive, and carry their favorite ball, bat, or truck everywhere.  On the other hand, some girls and boys reject these stereotypical expressions of gender identity, preferring to choose toys, playmates, interests, mannerisms, and hairstyles that are more often associated with the opposite sex. These children are sometimes called gender expansive, gender variant, gender nonconforming, gender creative, or gender atypical. Among these gender expansive children are some who may come to feel that their deep inner sense of being female or male—their gender identity—is the opposite of their biologic sex, somewhere in between male and female, or another gender; these children are sometimes called transgender\\u200b.  Given that many three-year-old children are doubling down on gender stereotypes, this can be an age in which a gender-expansive child stands out from the crowd. These children are normal and healthy, but it can be difficult for parents to navigate their child's expression and identity if it is different from their expectations or the expectations of those around them. \", \" As children develop their own identity during these early years, they're bound to experiment with attitudes and behaviors of both sexes. There's rarely reason to discourage such impulses, except when the child is resisting or rejecting strongly established cultural standards. If your son wanted to wear dresses every day or your daughter only wants to wear sport shorts like her big brother, allow the phase to pass unless it is inappropriate for a specific event. If the child persists, however, or seems unusually upset about their gender, discuss the issue with your pediatrician.  Your child also may imitate certain types of behavior that adults consider sexual, such as flirting. Children this age have no mature sexual intentions, though; they mimic these mannerisms. If the imitation of sexual behavior is explicit, though,\\xa0they may have been personally exposed to sexual acts. You should discuss this with your pediatrician, as it could be a sign of sexual abuse or the influence of inappropriate media or videogames. \", ' By age four, your child should have an active social life filled with friends, and they may even have a \"best friend.\" Ideally, they\\'ll have neighborhood and preschool friends they see routinely. But what if your child is not enrolled in preschool and doesn\\'t live near other children the same age? In these cases, you might arrange play sessions with other preschoolers. Parks, playgrounds, and preschool activity programs all provide excellent opportunities to meet other children.  Once your preschooler has found playmates they seems to enjoy, you need to take initiative to help build their relationships. Encourage them to invite these friends to your home. It\\'s important for your child to \"show off\" their home, family, and possessions to other children. This will establish a sense of self-pride. Incidentally, to generate this pride, their home needn\\'t be luxurious or filled with expensive toys; it needs only be warm and welcoming.  It\\'s also important to recognize that at this age your child\\'s friends are not just playmates. They also actively influence their thinking and behavior. They\\'ll desperately want to be just like them, even when they break rules and standards you\\'ve taught them rrm birth. They now realize there are other values and opinions besides yours, and they may test this new discovery by demanding things you\\'ve never allowed him—certain toys, foods, clothing, or permission to watch certain TV programs. ', \" Don't despair if your child's relationship with you changes dramatically in light of these new friendships. They may be rude to you for the first time in their life.Hard as it may be to accept, this sassiness actually is a positive sign that they're learning to challenge authority and test their independence. Once again, deal with it by expressing disapproval, and possibly discussing with them what they really mean or feel. If you react emotionally, you'll encourage continued bad behavior. If the subdued approach doesn't work and they persist in talking back to you, a time-out (or time-in) is the most effective form of punishment.  Bear in mind that even though your child is exploring the concepts of good and bad, they still have an extremely simplified sense of morality. When they obey rules rigidly, it's not necessarily because they understand them, but more likely because they wants to avoid punishment. In their mind, consequences count but not intentions. When theybreaks something of value, they'll probably assume they are bad, even if they didn't brea it on purpose. They need to be taught the difference between accidents and misbehaving. \", ' To help them learn this difference, you need to separate them from their behavior. When they do or say something that calls for punishment, make sure they understand they are being punished for the act not because they\\'re \"bad.\" Describe specifically what they did wrong, clearly separating person from behavior. If they are picking on a younger sibling, explain why it is wrong rather than saying \"You\\'re bad.\" When they do something wrong without meaning to, comfort them and say you understand it was unintentional. Try not to get upset, or they\\'ll think you\\'re angry at them rather than about what they did.  It\\'s also important to give your preschooler tasks that you know they can do and then praise them when they do them well. They are ready for simple responsibilities, such as setting the table or cleaning their room. On family outings, explain that you expect them to behave well, and congratulate them when they do. Along with responsibilities, give them ample opportunities to play with other children, and tell him how proud you are when they shares or is helpful to another child. ', \" Finally, it's important to recognize that the relationship with older siblings can be particularly challenging, especially if the sibling is three to four years older. Often your four-year-old is eager to do everything their older sibling is doing; just as often, your older child resents the intrusion. They may resent the intrusion on their space, their friends, their more daring and busy pace, and especially their room and things. You often become the mediator of these squabbles. It's important to seek middle ground. Allow your older child their own time, independence, and private activities and space; but also foster cooperative play appropriate. Family vacations are great opportunities to enhance the positives of their relationship and at the same time give each their own activity and special time.

', ' Here are some general strategies and solutions to help you live with a youngster with bothersome temperament traits:  First, recognize that much of your child\\'s behavior reflects his temperament.  Establish a neutral or objective emotional climate in which to deal with your child. Try not to respond in an emotional and instinctive manner, which is unproductive.  Don\\'t take your child\\'s behavior personally. Temperament is innate, and your child probably is not purposely trying to be difficult or irritating. Don\\'t blame him or yourself.  Try to prioritize the issues and problems surrounding your child. Some are more important and deserve greater attention. Others are not as relevant and can be either ignored or put \"way down the list.\"  Focus on the issues of the moment. Do not project into the future.  Review your expectations of your child, your preferences and your values. Are they realistic and appropriate? When your youngster does something right, praise him and reinforce the specific behaviors that you like.  Consider your own temperament and behavior, and how they might also be difficult. Think how you might need to adjust yourself a bit to encourage a better fit with your child.  Anticipate impending high-risk situations, and try to avoid or minimize them. Accept the possibility that this may be a difficult day or circumstance, and be prepared to make the best of it.  Find a way to get some relief for yourself and your child by scheduling some time apart.  Seek professional help, when needed, from your pediatrician or another expert in child behavior.

', \" From time to time most children defy the wishes of their parents. This is a part of growing up and testing adult guidelines and expectations. It is one way for children to learn about and discover their own selves, express their individuality, and achieve a sense of autonomy. As they stretch their independent wings and engage in minor conflicts with their parents, they discover the boundaries of their parents' rules and of their own self-control.  Sometimes, however, these conflicts are more than occasional disturbances and become a pattern for how parents and children interact. Disobedience can have a variety of causes. At times, it is due to unreasonable parental expectations. Or it might be related to the child's temperament, or to school problems, family stress, or conflicts between his parents. \", \" When you have a chronically disobedient child, examine the possible sources of his inner turmoil and rebelliousness. If this has been a persistent pattern that has continued into middle childhood, closely evaluate your own family situation:  How much respect do your family members show for one another?  Do they respect one another's privacy, ideas, and personal values?  How does the family work out its conflicts?  Are disagreements resolved through rational discussion, or do people regularly argue or resort to violence?  What is your usual style of relating to your child, and what forms does discipline usually take?  How much spanking and yelling is there?  Do you and your child have very different personalities and ways of getting along in the world that cause friction between you?  Is your child having trouble succeeding at school or developing friendships?  Is the family undergoing some especially stressful times?  If your child has only recently started to demonstrate disrespect and disobedience, tell him that you have noticed a difference in his behavior and that you sense he is unhappy or struggling. With his help, try to determine the specific cause of his frustration or upset. This is the first step toward helping him change his behavior. \", \" If you react to your child's talking back by exploding or losing your temper, he will respond with disobedience and disrespect. By contrast, he will become more obedient when you remain calm, cooperative, and consistent. He will learn to be respectful if you are respectful toward him and others in the family. If he becomes disobedient and out of control, impose a timeout until he calms down and regains self-control.  When your child is obedient and respectful, compliment him for that behavior. Reward the behavior you are seeking, including cooperation and resolution of disagreements. These positive efforts will always be much more successful than punishment. \", \" For some disobedient children, you may need to obtain professional mental health treatment. Here are some situations where outside counseling may be necessary:  If there is a persistent, long-standing pattern of disrespect of authority both at school and at home.  If the patterns of disobedience continue in spite of your best efforts to encourage your child to communicate his negative feelings  If a child's disobedience and/or disrespect is accompanied by aggressiveness and destructiveness  If a child shows signs of generalized unhappiness -- perhaps talking of feeling blue, unliked, friendless, or even suicidal  If your family has developed a pattern of responding to disagreements with physical or emotional abuse  If you or your spouse or child use alcohol or other drugs to feel better or cope with stress  If relationships within your family show signs of difficulty and lack of cooperation, then family therapy may be indicated.

After the rapid growth of infancy, when babies usually triple in weight, a toddler’s growth rate – and appetite – tends to slow down.  Toddlers also are beginning to develop food preferences, a fickle process. A toddler’s favorite food one day may hit the floor the next, or a snubbed food might suddenly become the one he or she can’t get enough of. For weeks, they may eat 1 or 2 preferred foods – and\\xa0nothing else.  Try not to get frustrated by this typical toddler behavior. Just make healthy food choices available and know that, with time, your child\\'s appetite and eating behaviors will level out. In the meantime, here are some tips that can help you get through the picky eater stage.  1. Family style. Share a meal together as a family as often as you can. This means no\\xa0media distractions like TV or cell phones at mealtime.\\xa0Use this time to model healthy eating. Serve one meal for the whole family and resist the urge to make another meal if your child refuses what you\\'ve served. This only encourages picky eating. Try to include at least one food your child likes with each meal and continue to provide a balanced meal, whether she eats it or not.  2. Food fights. If your toddler refuses a meal, avoid fussing over it. It’s good for children to learn to listen to their bodies and use hunger as a guide. If they ate a big breakfast or lunch, for example, they may not be interested in eating much the rest of the day. It\\'s a parent\\'s responsibility to provide food, and the child’s decision to eat it. Pressuring kids to eat, or punishing them if they don\\'t, can make them actively dislike foods they may otherwise like.  3. Break from bribes. Tempting as it may be, try not to bribe your children with treats for eating other foods. This can make the \"prize\" food even more exciting, and the food you want them to try an unpleasant chore. It also can lead to nightly battles at the dinner table.  4. Try, try again. Just because a child refuses a food once, don\\'t give up. Keep offering new foods and those your child didn\\'t like before. It can take as many as 10 or more times tasting a food before a toddler’s taste buds accept it. Scheduled meals and limiting snacks can help ensure your child is hungry when a new food is introduced.  5. Variety: the spice. Offer a variety of healthy foods, especially vegetables and fruits, and include higher protein foods like meat and deboned fish at least 2 times per week. Help your child explore new flavors and textures in food. Try adding different herbs and spices to simple meals to make them tastier. To minimize waste, offer new foods in small amounts and wait at least a week or two before reintroducing the same food.  6. Make food fun. Toddlers are especially open to trying foods arranged in eye-catching, creative ways. Make foods look irresistible by arranging them in fun, colorful shapes kids can recognize. Kids this age also tend to enjoy any food involving a dip.\\xa0Finger foods are also usually a hit with toddlers. Cut solid foods into bite size pieces they can easily eat themselves, making sure the pieces are small enough to avoid the risk of choking.  7. Involve kids in meal planning. Put your toddler\\'s growing interest in exercising control to good use. Let you child pick which\\xa0fruit and vegetable to make for dinner or during visits to the grocery store or farmer\\'s market. Read kid-friendly cookbooks together and let your child pick out new recipes to try.  8. Tiny chefs. Some cooking tasks are perfect for toddlers (with lots of supervision, of course): sifting, stirring, counting ingredients, picking fresh herbs from a garden or windowsill, and “painting” on cooking oil with a pastry brush, to name a few.  9. Crossing bridges.\\xa0 Once a food is accepted, use what nutritionists call \"food bridges\" to introduce others with similar color, flavor and texture to help expand variety in what your child will eat.\\xa0If your child likes pumpkin pie, for example, try mashed sweet potatoes and then mashed carrots.  10. A fine pair. Try serving unfamiliar foods, or flavors young children tend to dislike at first (sour and bitter), with familiar foods toddlers naturally prefer (sweet and salty). Pairing broccoli (bitter) with grated cheese (salty), for example, is a great combination for toddler taste buds. ', ' If you are concerned about your child’s diet, talk with your pediatrician, who can help troubleshoot and make sure your child is getting all the necessary nutrients to grow and develop. Also keep in mind that picky eating usually is a normal developmental stage for toddlers. Do your best to patiently guide them on their path toward healthy eating.

If you’ve ever tried to get your child to eat without all the success you’d hoped for, this new book may be just what you need.  As the mother of a 22-month-old boy who has discovered the power of stating his dining opinions firmly, I couldn’t have received more timely support than that of my latest read, Food Fights: Winning the Nutritional Challenges of Parenthood Armed with Insights, Humor, and a Bottle of Ketchup, by Laura A. Jana, M.D., FAAP, and Jennifer Shu, M.D., FAAP, and published by the AAP.  Readers are likely to have the same sentiment regardless of their child’s age. After all, feeding one’s children is an ongoing responsibility of parenthood that often becomes complicated by stage-specific needs — and that in addition to a mountain of well-intentioned advice and government recommendations.  A quick search on “child nutrition” at Amazon.com Books finds\\xa0more than 4,700 results. Pediatricians Jana and Shu know that despite being exposed to all that information, we are still left with questions. Fortunately, they have practical, reality-based answers. ', ' \"It is impossible to ignore the fact that food-related battles rank right at the top of the daily list of parental challenges,” write the co-authors. They let you know right away that they mean business, but they do it with the kind of encouragement that you hope to gain from bonding with fellow parents.  Barely into the first chapter of Food Fights, one sure statement is enough to convince you:  “With some basic insights along with some palatable peacekeeping strategies, you can win the nutritional challenges of parenthood and play a defining role in shaping your child’s lifelong eating habits.”  Thank goodness I resisted the urge to skip the practical advice for the newborn period in lieu of heading straight for more curious matters — such as why “everything tastes better with ketchup.” With plenty of comic relief, Drs. Jana and Shu draw on research, anecdotes, their experiences as pediatricians and mothers, and best practices.  “Reviewing the underlying principles of what you do and what you do for your kids can serve as a powerful way to relate to them. Sometimes people can see it for themselves but not their kids,” says Dr. Jana. ', ' Before delving into the book’s main subject matter, Drs. Jana and Shu present two facts that can often be traced to poor nutritional habits:  Children with obese parents are 80 percent more likely to become obese themselves  30 percent of American adults over the age of 20 are considered obese  Once the idea is introduced, it seems obvious enough that a child wants whatever his or her parents eat. But it’s a great reminder for those of us who become parents believing we’ll become more health-conscious as our baby develops more astute observation skills.  If that’s the case, it is one of the first ways parents are vulnerable to “slippery slopes,” or routines that “ease themselves into existence while we’re too busy going about our parenting business to notice,” as the authors describe it.  “While we had every intention of focusing our\\xa0attention on the questions parents typically ask that are specific to their kids, we constantly found ourselves discussing eating habits in general,” write the authors. “After all, if we as parents can’t get our own eating habits and waistlines under control, how is it that we think we will be able to teach our children to do so?” ', ' “Parents often get themselves into a pattern and don’t know what’s coming or how to make the next transition. We’re giving people a heads-up before they turn what was a good thing into a bad habit,” says Shu. She points out that once these habits are formed, we often admit that if someone had told us ahead of time, we might have done things differently.  Consider some common examples, such as:  Middle-of-the-night feedings  Battles over the bottle  The cure-all status of a sippy-cup  Food Fights introduces 10 “palatable peacekeeping strategies” to keep in mind. Meant as techniques to solve or prevent food-related struggles, the ideas surface throughout the book and illustrate the power of being proactive, rather than reactive. They also provide comfort for parents, who shouldn’t feel that they’re facing this battle alone.  “A lot of principles are the same from age to age,” says Dr. Jana. “Once you extract all the fundamental principles, you can basically apply them to just about any food fight that arises.” ', ' There is a message embedded throughout the book that parents need to hear over and over: Be patient with yourself, be patient with your children. One of the peacekeeping strategies is emphatic on this point: “If at first you don’t succeed … try, try again.” Along with that, another point reminds you “the food pyramid wasn’t built in a day.”  Another solution involves some patience, as well: the “no thank-you” bite, a tried-and-true source of compromise. Studies show that it can take between 10 and 15 tastes of one type of food before a child accepts it or likes it. Offering your child one taste before allowing him or her to refuse a dish adds up toward the desired result.  “Don’t take ‘no’ as a rejection,” says Dr. Jana. “You’re making progress by just exposing your child to new foods and flavors.” ', ' Aside from its focus on the habits of daily eating in addition to the other body functions associated with it, a large section of Food Fights is dedicated to the challenges of eating away from home. This can entail dining with family and friends, at restaurants, and even on a plane.  “If you set the tone with consistency and expectations, children will be more likely to know that you expect them to act that way at somebody else’s house or a restaurant,” says Dr. Shu. “You always have to look at the next step.”  Indeed, Food Fights helps give you the confidence to look ahead to that next step. You don’t need to be daunted by the prospect of reading through every “childhood nutrition” book on the market. An outline of children’s tales recommended in the chapter called “Read All About It!”, however, seems like a much better idea.  Just remember: Your food fights are a battle your entire family can win one bite at a time.

More than a year after the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) joined with other organizations to declare \\r      a national emergency in youth mental health, many teens are still struggling.  Still, you may wonder whether the symptoms are part of the biological and social changes all young people go through on their way to adulthood, or something more.

Read on to learn more about teen\\xa0mental health, including signs\\xa0someone is struggling and\\xa0may need more support.\\xa0You can also visit the AAP YouTube channel for a series of videos for teens on mental health.\\xa0The videos address topics including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm and other topics.

Biological changes, including the \\r      hormone shifts all tweens and teens go through, can affect your child's mood, school performance and more. But if you consistently see one or more of these signs, it's time to open a conversation about mental health with your teen. \", ' Young people face pretty much the same array of mental health challenges that adults do. However, these are the most common mental health conditions seen in U.S. tweens and teens:  Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) affects nearly 10% of all U.S. kids aged 3 to 17.

Nearly 9.5% experience \\r            anxiety that interferes with their everyday functioning.  Around 4.5% live with \\r            depression.

In teens, depression may or may not look like the stereotyped tearful blues. Symptoms of depression can sometimes look more like anger/irritability.  Though they are less common, \\r      eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa can cause major health problems for teens and young adults. \\r      Self-harm,thought to be underreported, is another serious concern for tweens and teens. ', \" Substance use is very common among teens. It can combine with mental health issues (and in most cases, making them worse).  Around 15% of all high-school students say they have used street drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, inhalants, heroin, meth, hallucinogens or MDMA (also called ecstasy or molly). Some 14% report they have misused prescription opioids. Nearly 30% say they've tried alcohol and 14% admit to binge drinking. A frightening 17% got into a car driven by someone who had been drinking, exposing them to a whole new level of danger.  Substance use is a concern all its own—one you should definitely \\r      discuss with your teen, even if you don't see signs of mental health issues. But noticing it alongside mental health symptoms raises extra concern. Drinking and drugs are often used to cope with difficult feelings or circumstances. This can signal deep emotional pain that needs to be addressed. \", ' Young people spend a lot of time on sites such as Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and others. One study found that 90% of teens aged 13 to 18 use multiple platforms, with more than 60% engaging with social media every day.  We are still learning about the ways social media can affect human health, especially among children and teens. Healthy use of social media can foster positive connections. However, some young people may face greater risks for negative effects. See \"Social Media & Your Child\\'s Mental Health: What the Research Says\" for insights that can help you consider social media\\'s impact on your child. ', ' Here are some points to consider as you open the door to discussing your teen\\'s mental health. Ideally, this should be a a series of ongoing conversations and \"check ins\" that you have with your child. This can help support your child\\'s mental health and also give you a foundation for times your child may be struggling more and need more problem-focused support.  Make it safe for your child to discuss tough issues with you. Kids often avoid talking about touchy subjects, especially if they expect to be judged, lectured or punished. If you haven\\'t already made this clear, affirm that your teen can tell you anything. Emphasize that these conversations will take place in a judgment-free zone. Explain that you want to understand what they\\'re going through and provide loving support.  Make it safe for your child to discuss tough issues with you.

You will need to manage your own fears during the conversation so you can avoid \\r            autobiographical listening.

If you\\'re concerned you might be missing the warning signs of suicide, here is \\r      an article that may help. ', ' Also keep in mind that mental health is not just about responding to problems. It is important to promote positive mental health and resilience in everyday, proactive ways.  Even if your teen is doing fine, help them find time for self care and healthy habits. Make time to enjoy each other as a family. Positive activities and relationships can have a protective, \"scaffolding\" effect on mental health.  We all have good days and bad days, just as days when we feel healthier than other times. Mental health should stay on our radar; promoting it should be among our day-to-day goals.

They're tucked into your bag. Stacked near the crib. Stored in boxes under beds. You might even have a few stashed in the glove compartment of your car, just in case.  Diapers are part of your life, day in, day out, for so long that it's hard to imagine not needing them anymore. It seems like the day when your child will walk into the bathroom, pee or poop, wipe, wash hands, and walk back out without you even knowing it is a long way off.  And yet, that day is coming. And it’ll be as glorious as it has been in your dreams. Between now and then, there's a big project: potty training, or to use the grown-up term, toilet training. You may be ready to make the transition, but is your little one? \", \" With potty training, just like talking, walking, and sleeping through the night, every child's timing is different. There’s no perfect age to start potty training. How will you know if your child is ready? They’ll show interest in various ways, including asking questions about the toilet, potty seats, and underwear.  Whether or not your child is ready depends on where they are physically and emotionally. Many kids show interest around 2, while others couldn't care less until they're 2 1/2 or 3. But there are always exceptions. Girls usually show interest earlier than boys and are quicker to get the hang of it.  There's no need to whip out a potty seat the second your child's questions start. Ask yourself a few questions first:  Can my child sit on a potty seat and get back up without my help?

Horrified, you rush to discipline your pint-sized vampire -- but what's the best way to handle the situation?  Biting is a normal part of childhood development. Young children bite for many different reasons, from teething to seeing what reaction it will provoke. Many children between ages 1 and 3 go through a biting phase, which they eventually outgrow.  Still, biting is something you want to discourage. Fortunately, there are ways to dissuade your little chomper from sinking their\\xa0teeth into everything that walks and talks. \", \" Kids bite for a number of reasons -- and most of them aren't intentionally malicious.  They're in pain. When babies bite, typically it's because they're teething. They're just doing it to relieve the pain of their swollen, tender gums.  They're exploring their world. Very young children use their mouths to explore, just as they use their hands. Just about everything infants or toddlers pick up eventually winds up in their mouths. Kids this age aren't yet able to prevent themselves from biting the object of their interest.  They're looking for a reaction. Part of exploration is curiosity. Toddlers experiment to see what kind of reaction their actions will provoke. They'll bite down on a friend or sibling to hear the surprised exclamation, not realizing how painful the experience is for that person.  They're craving attention. In older kids, biting is just one of several bad behaviors used to get attention. When a child feels ignored, discipline is at least one way of getting noticed -- even if the attention is negative rather than positive.  They're frustrated. Biting, like hitting, is a way for some children to assert themselves when they're still too young to express feelings effectively through words. To your child, biting is a way to get back a favorite toy, tell you that they are unhappy, or let another child know that they want to be left alone. \", ' Practice prevention so that your child will be less likely to bite in the first place.  If your baby is teething, make sure to always have a cool teething ring or washcloth on hand so they will be less likely to sink teeth into someone\\'s arm.  Avoid situations in which your child can get irritable enough to bite. Make sure that all of your child\\'s needs -- including eating and nap time -- are taken care of before you go out to play. Bring along a snack to soothe your child if they get cranky from being hungry.  As soon as your child is old enough, encourage the use of words (\"I\\'m angry with you\" or \"That\\'s my toy\") instead of biting. Other ways to express frustration or anger include hugging a stuffed animal or punching a pillow. Sometimes, shortening activities or giving your child a break can help prevent the rising frustration that can lead to biting and other bad behaviors.  Give your child enough of your time throughout the day (for example, by reading or playing together), so they don\\'t bite just to get attention. Extra attention is especially important when your child is going through a major life change, such as a move or welcoming a baby sibling. If your child is prone to biting, keep an eye on any playmates and step in when an altercation appears to be brewing.  Even with your best prevention efforts, biting incidents might still occur. When your child bites, firmly let your child know that this behavior is not acceptable by saying, \"No. We don\\'t bite!\" Explain that biting hurts the other person. Then remove your child from the situation and give the child time to calm down.  You might have heard from other parents that if your child bites you, bite your child back. This isn\\'t good advice. Children learn by imitation. If you bite your child, the child is going to get the impression that this behavior is acceptable and they will be more likely to do it again. The same goes for hitting a child for biting.  If you are unable to get your child to stop biting, the behavior could begin to have an impact on school and relationships. You or another adult might have to closely supervise interactions between your child and other kids. When biting becomes a habit or continues past age 4 or 5, it might stem from a more serious emotional problem. Talk to your child\\'s health care provider, or enlist the help of a child psychologist or therapist. ', \" The first thing to do for any biting injury is to wash the area with soap and water. Even little teeth can break the skin. If the bite is bleeding and the wound appears to be deep, call your child's doctor. The bite may need medical treatment, which could include antibiotics or a tetanus shot, or both. \", ' SOURCES:  Iowa State University: \"Biting.\"  American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons: \"Human Bites.\"  Missouri Families.org: \"What to Do About Biting?\"  American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry: \"Fighting and Biting.\"  University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension: \"When a Child Bites.\" ', ' How to Discipline Kids Without Spanking  7 Signs You Might Be a Helicopter Parent  What to Do About Bedwetting  Crazy Things Teens Use to Get High  Gross Things Kids Do  When Your Child Has Migraines ', ' Printable Good Behavior Awards for Kids  The Hyperactive Child  Cutting & Self-Harm: Warning Signs and Treatment  Rite of Passage or Cry for Help?

How to get your child to live and learn -- and not lose your cool in the process.  Have you ever found yourself in deep negotiations with your 2-year-old over whether they can wear their princess costume to preschool for the fifth day in a row? Have you taken the \"walk of shame\" out of the local supermarket after your toddler threw a temper tantrum on the floor? There may be comfort in knowing you’re not alone, but that doesn’t make navigating the early years of discipline any easier.  Toddlerhood is a particularly vexing time for parents because this is the age at which children start to become more independent and discover themselves as individuals. Yet they still have a limited ability to communicate and reason.  Child development specialist Claire Lerner, director of parenting resources for the nonprofit organization Zero to Three, says, \"They understand that their actions matter -- they can make things happen. This leads them to want to make their imprint on the world and assert themselves in a way they didn\\'t when they were a baby. The problem is they have very little self-control and they\\'re not rational thinkers. It\\'s a very challenging combination.\"  Here are a few simple toddler discipline strategies to help make life easier for your whole family when your self-asserting toddler needs direction. ', ' Order and routine give young children a safe haven from what they view as an overwhelming and unpredictable world, Lerner says. \"When there\\'s some predictability and routine, it makes children feel much more safe and secure, and they tend to be much more behaved and calm because they know what to expect.\"  Try to keep to the same schedule every day. That means having consistent nap times, mealtimes, and bedtimes as well as times when your toddler is free to just run around and have fun.  Warn your child in advance if you do have to make a change. Telling your child \"Aunt Jean is going to watch you tonight while Mommy and Daddy go out for a little bit\" will prepare them for a slightly different routine and may prevent a scene at bedtime.  Consistency is also important when it comes to discipline. When you say \"no hitting\" the first time your child smacks another child on the playground, you also need to say \"no hitting\" the second, third, and fourth time your child does it. ', ' By the time your child has reached the toddler stage, you\\'ve spent enough time with them to know what triggers reactions. The most common ones are hunger, sleepiness, and quick changes of venue. Avoid these potential meltdown scenarios with a little advance planning.  Pediatrician Lisa Asta, associate clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, says, \"You have to anticipate, which means you don\\'t go to the grocery store when your child needs a nap.\"  Try to make sure your child is home at naptimes, bedtimes, and mealtimes. If you are out, always keep food on hand in case of a sudden hunger attack. Keep excursions short (that means finding another restaurant if the one you\\'ve chosen has an hour-long wait or doing your grocery shopping at times when the lines are shortest). Finally, plan ahead so you don\\'t have to rush (particularly when you need to get your child to preschool and yourself to work in the mornings).  You can ease transitions by involving your child in the process. That can be as simple as setting an egg timer for five minutes and saying that when it rings it\\'s time to take a bath or get dressed. Or it can be as easy as giving your child a choice of whether to wear the red or the blue shirt to school.  Remember to think out loud and update your son or daughter about what is next on the schedule. Toddlers can understand much more than they can express. ', ' Toddlers aren\\'t mini-adults. They have trouble understanding many of the things we take for granted, like how to follow directions and behave appropriately. Seeing the scenario from a toddler\\'s perspective can help prevent a tantrum.  \"You might say, \\'I know, Derek, you don\\'t like getting into the car seat. But it\\'s what we have to do,\\'\" Lerner says. \"So you\\'re not coddling, but you\\'re validating their feelings. You have to set the limit, but you do it in a way that respects the child, and you use it as an opportunity to help them learn to cope with life\\'s frustrations and rules and regulations.\"  Giving choices also shows that you respect your toddler and recognize the child\\'s feelings. Asking your child if they want to bring a favorite book in the car or take along a snack can make the child feel as though they have some control over the situation while you remain in charge, Lerner says. ', ' Make your toddler\\'s short attention span work for you. When your child throws the ball against the dining room wall for the 10th time after you\\'ve said to stop, it\\'s pretty easy to redirect your child to a more productive activity, like trading the ball for a favorite book or moving the game outside.  Rex Forehand, the Heinz and Rowena Ansbacher Professor of Psychology at the University of Vermont and author of Parenting the Strong-Willed Child, says, \"[Parents] need to create an environment that is most conducive to good toddler behavior. If they\\'re into something they\\'re not supposed to do, the idea is not to punish them but to get another activity going or pick them up and put them in another room.\" ', ' Time-outs are one of the foundations of child discipline, but they may not be the best approach for the toddler stage. The negative implication of being sent away can teach kids that they\\'re bad rather than promote good behavior.  If you do give your child a time-out, limit it to just a minute or two at this age. Instead of calling it a time-out, which can be confusing to children under 3, refer to it as something more positive.  Lerner suggests creating a \"cozy corner,\" a safe place free from distractions and stimulation where your child can just chill out for a few minutes until they can get back in control. That time away can help you regroup as well.  Correct bad behaviors, but also take the time to praise good behaviors. Asta says, \"If you don\\'t tell your child when they\\'re doing the right thing, sometimes they\\'ll do the wrong thing just to get attention.\" When you tell your toddler they have done something good, there\\'s a good chance your child will want to do it again. ', ' It’s easy for your blood pressure to reach the boiling point when you’re in the middle of watching your child throw a tantrum. But losing control will quickly escalate an already stressful situation. Give yourself some time to cool off, Forehand says. \"Otherwise, you\\'re venting your own anger. In the end that\\'s going to make you, as a parent, feel worse and guilty. And it\\'s not going to do your child any good.\"  \"I call it the \\'Stepford Wife\\' approach,\" Lerner says. \"As your child screams, say, \\'I know, I know,\\' but stay completely calm as you pick them up. Don\\'t show any emotion.\"  Sometimes the best tactic is to ignore the behavior entirely. \"You just literally act like they\\'re not doing what they\\'re doing,\" Lerner says. \"You ignore the behavior you want to stop.\" When your child realizes that their screaming fit is not going to get them a second lollipop or your attention, eventually they\\'ll get tired of yelling.  Your child may drive you so close to the breaking point that you\\'re tempted to spank them. But most experts warn against the practice. \"When we spank, kids learn that physical punishment is acceptable. And so we are modeling exactly what we don\\'t want our kids to do,\" Forehand says. At the toddler stage, redirection and brief breaks are far more effective discipline tactics, he says. ', ' Certain things in a toddler\\'s life are nonnegotiable. They have to eat, brush their\\xa0teeth, and ride in a car seat. They\\xa0also have to take baths once in a while. Hitting and biting are never OK. But many other issues aren\\'t worth the headache of an argument. Pick your battles.  \"You have to decide whether it\\'s worth fighting about, and about half the time it\\'s not worth fighting about,\" Asta says. That means it\\'s OK to let your son wear their superhero costume to the grocery store or read The Giving Tree 10 times in a row. Once they get what they want, you can gradually get them to shift in another direction -- like wearing another outfit or picking out a different book to read.  Finally, know that it\\'s OK to feel stressed out by your toddler sometimes. \"Realize that none of us as parents is perfect -- we do the best we can. There are going to be days that we\\'re better at this than other days,\" Forehand says. \"But if we parent consistently and have consistent rules, then we\\'re going to see more good days than bad days.\" ', ' SOURCES:  Claire Lerner, LCSW-C, child development specialist; director of parenting resources, Zero to Three.

That doesn\\'t mean, though, you can\\'t prevent it.  Anne Crawford has three children, ages 8 through 13, so she has heard her share of whining.  \"My kids whine about doing the chores,\" she says, \"or about how unfair it is that one got something and the other didn\\'t. I\\'d say whining pretty much comes with the territory.\"  According to Bay Area pediatrician Laurel Schultz, kids whine for a very simple reason. It works. \"Whining gets the parent\\'s attention,\" Schultz says. \"A high-pitched whine is effective because a parent can\\'t not attend to it.\" ', ' Schultz explains this is not a conscious strategy on the part of children, but a learned behavior -- and parents often play a role. If a child asks for something in a polite way and the parent doesn\\'t respond the first time or two, the child will amp up the volume. A small child may holler or even throw a tantrum. But an older child, who has more self-control, is likely to whine.  To avoid whining, Schultz advises parents not to wait until children are in distress to acknowledge them. \"It\\'s important to respond to that first bid for attention, if you can,\" she says. \"If you are on the phone or in the middle of a conversation, make eye contact with your child and put a finger up, so she knows you\\'ll be with her in a minute. Then give your child your attention as soon as you can politely do so.\" ', ' Educator and developmental psychologist Becky Bailey says that when whining does occur, parents should take a deep breath and remind themselves that the child is not trying to be irritating. The child is actually asking for help.  \"Respond with I-statements,\" Bailey says, \"and model the way you want the child to speak. Say something like, \\'I don\\'t like it when you whine. If you want a glass of milk, say it like this.\\' Then model the exact words and tone you want the child to use.\"  If your child continues to whine, and you\\'re sure it\\'s not from pain or illness, Bailey suggests that you look beyond the whiny behavior to determine the larger message it conveys. \"Ask yourself, \\'Have I been busier than usual? Has my child\\'s routine changed? Has a sibling required more attention for some reason?\\' Often, whining is a signal it\\'s time to reconnect with your child.\"  To do that, she advises that you spend some focused time together reading, cooking a meal, or doing something else the child enjoys. \"A few minutes connecting with your child once or twice a day can make a huge difference for families dealing with difficult behaviors,\" Bailey says.

What Other Problems Are Associated With Encopresis?  What Is the Outlook for Children With Encopresis?  Can Encopresis Be Prevented? ', ' Elimination disorders occur in children who have problems going to the bathroom -- both defecating and urinating. Although it is not uncommon for young children to have occasional \"accidents,\" there may be a problem if this behavior occurs repeatedly for longer than three months, particularly in children older than 5 years.  There are two types of elimination disorders, encopresis and enuresis.  Encopresis is the repeated passing of feces into places other than the toilet, such as in underwear or on the floor. This behavior may or may not be done on purpose.  Enuresisis the repeated passing of urine in places other than the toilet. Enuresis that occurs at night, or bed-wetting, is the most common type of elimination disorder. As with encopresis, this behavior may or may not be done on purpose. ', ' In addition to defecating in improper places, a child with encopresis may have other symptoms, including:  Loss of appetite  Abdominal pain  Loose, watery stools (bowel movements)  Scratching or rubbing the anal area due to irritation from watery stools  Decreased interest in physical activity  Withdrawal from friends and family  Secretive behavior associated with bowel movements ', \" The most common cause of encopresis is chronic (long-term) constipation, the inability to release stools from the bowel. This may occur for several reasons, including stress, not drinking enough water (which makes the stools hard and difficult to pass), and pain caused by a sore in or near the anus.  When a child is constipated, a large mass of feces develops, which stretches the rectum. This stretching dulls the nerve endings in the rectum, and the child may not feel the need to go to the bathroom or know that waste is coming out. The mass of feces also can become impacted -- too large or too hard to pass without pain. Eventually, the muscles that keep stool in the rectum can no longer hold it back. Although the large, hard mass of feces cannot pass, loose or liquid stool may leak around the impacted mass and onto the child's clothing.  Factors that may contribute to constipation include:  A diet low in fiber  Lack of exercise  Fear or reluctance to use unfamiliar bathrooms, such as public restrooms  Not taking the time to use the bathroom  Changes in bathroom routines; for example, scheduled bathroom breaks at school or camp  Another possible cause of encopresis is a physical problem related to the intestine's ability to move stool. The child also may develop encopresis because of fear or frustration related to toilet training. Stressful events in the child's life, such as a family illness or the arrival of a new sibling, may contribute to the disorder. In some cases, the child simply refuses to use the toilet. \", \" Encopresis is fairly common, although many cases are not reported due to the child's and/or the parents' embarrassment. It is estimated that anywhere from 1.5% to 10% of children have encopresis. It is more common in boys than in girls. \", \" If symptoms of encopresis are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam. The doctor may use certain tests -- such as X-rays -- to rule out other possible causes for the constipation, such as a disorder of the intestines. If no physical disorder is found, the doctor will base a diagnosis on the child's symptoms and current bowel habits. \", \" The goal of encopresis treatment is to prevent constipation and encourage good bowel habits. Educating the child and family about the disorder is another important part of treatment.  Treatment often begins by clearing any feces that has become impacted in the colon, also called the large intestine. The next step is to try to keep the child's bowel movements soft and easy to pass. In most cases, this can be accomplished by changing the child's diet, using scheduled trips to the bathroom, and encouraging or rewarding positive changes in the child's bathroom habits. In more severe cases, the doctor may recommend using stool softeners or laxatives to help reduce constipation. Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) may be used to help the child cope with the shame, guilt, or loss of self-esteem associated with the disorder. \", \" A child with encopresis is at risk for emotional and social problems related to the condition. They may develop self-esteem problems, become depressed, do poorly in school, and refuse to socialize with other children, including not wanting to go to parties or to attend events requiring them to stay overnight. Teasing by friends and scolding by family members can add to the child's self-esteem problems and contribute to the child's social isolation. If the child does not develop good bowel habits, they may suffer from chronic constipation. \", ' Encopresis tends to get better as the child gets older, although the problem can come and go for years. The best results occur when all educational, behavioral, and emotional issues are addressed. A child may still have an occasional accident until they regain\\xa0muscle tone and control over their bowel movements. ', ' Encopresis caused by constipation can often be prevented by ensuring the child is drinking adequate amounts of water and maintaining a high fiber diet. \\xa0Although it may not always be possible to prevent encopresis, getting treatment as soon as symptoms appear may help reduce the frustration and distress, as well as the potential complications related to the disorder. In addition, being positive and patient with a child during toilet training may help prevent any fear or negative feelings about using the toilet. ', ' SOURCE: Mayo Clinic.

All children have worries and fears from time to time. Whether it's the monster in the closet, the big test at the end of the week, or making the cut for the soccer team, kids have things that make them anxious, just like adults.  But sometimes anxiety in children crosses the line from normal everyday worries to a disorder that gets in the way of the things they need to do. It can even keep them from enjoying life as they should.  How can you tell if your child's anxieties might be more than just passing worries and fears? Here are some questions to ask yourself:  Are they expressing worry or showing anxiety on most days, for weeks at a time?  Do they have trouble sleeping at night? If you aren't sure (they might not tell you), do you notice that they seem unusually sleepy or tired during the day?  Are they having trouble concentrating?  Do they seem unusually irritable or easy to upset?  There are several different types of anxiety disorders that can affect children. The most common include: \", ' Remember the old Peanuts cartoon in which Lucy asks Charlie Brown if he has \"pantophobia?\" When they explain that pantophobia is \"the fear of everything,\" Charlie Brown yells, \"That\\'s it!\"  GAD is a bit like Charlie Brown\\'s pantophobia. Children with GAD worry excessively about lots of things: school, their own safety and health, the health of family members and friends, money, and their family\\'s security. The list can go on and on. A child with GAD may always imagine the worst possible thing that could happen.  Kids with GAD may experience physical symptoms because of these worries, like headaches and stomachaches. Your child may also isolate themselves, avoiding school and friends because they are so overwhelmed by their worries. ', \" A panic attack is a sudden, intense episode of anxiety with no apparent outside cause. Your child's heart pounds, and they may feel short of breath. Your child may tremble or feel dizzy or numb. (If your child is\\xa0hyperventilating, try to have them breathe slowly with nice deep breaths. Breathing in a brown paper bag can help.).  When your child has had two or more of these episodes, and is preoccupied with worries about them happening again, it is considered panic disorder. \", \" All children have some level of separation anxiety. It's a normal phase of development in babies and toddlers. Even older children may get clingy with their parents or caregivers occasionally, especially in new settings.  But older children who get unusually upset when leaving a parent or someone else close to them, who have trouble calming down after saying goodbye, or who get extremely homesick and upset when away from home at school, camp, or play dates, may have separation anxiety disorder. \", ' A child with social phobia feels severe anxiety and self-consciousness in normal, everyday, social situations. This is more than just shyness.  The socially anxious child is terrified that they will embarrass themselves when talking with classmates, answering a question in class, or doing other normal activities that involve interacting with others.  This fear can keep your child from participating in school and activities. Some children may even find themselves unable to talk at all in some situations. ', ' Mental health professionals today understand much more about childhood anxiety disorders than in the past. No matter what your child\\'s anxiety disorder is, you should be able to find a professional therapist who can help. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has many resources, including self-help publications, support groups, treatment guides, and a therapist search tool.  The United States Preventive Service Task Force recommends screening for anxiety in children and adolescents ages 8 to 18 years and screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents ages 12 to 18 years.  You can also help your child at home by being supportive and understanding.  If your child becomes upset and anxious, stay calm as you talk to them through it.  Don\\'t punish your child for things like mistakes on schoolwork or lack of progress.  \"Catch\" them doing well: Praise even small accomplishments, and be specific.  Plan for transitions. If your child\\'s anxiety means going to school in the morning is very stressful, allow plenty of extra time.  While respecting your child\\'s privacy, do give their teachers and coaches information they need to help them understand what\\'s going on.  Above all, be available to listen when your child wants to talk to you about their anxiety. Kids with anxiety disorders often try to hide their fears because they think you won\\'t understand. So let your child know you\\'re ready to listen whenever they\\'re ready to talk.

Lying at your feet is your toddler, who has just been informed (by you) that, no, they cannot have the Cinderella fruit snacks. Their face has turned a shade somewhere between red and purple. Their fists are pounding the floor in fury as they emit a shriek that can be heard in the farthest reaches of the parking lot. The other shoppers are gaping at this spectacle as you wish desperately for a hole to open in the floor and swallow you up.  Many a parent has been through a scenario like this, although the tantrum might have taken a slightly different form; crying, hitting, kicking, stomping, throwing things, and breath holding are all popular tantrum techniques.  Temper tantrums are exceedingly common in children, especially between ages 1 and 4 -- the early part of which is sometimes called the \"terrible 2s\" -- when kids are still learning how to communicate effectively. More than half of young children will have one or more tantrums a week as they vent their frustrations and protest their lack of control.  Although they are a normal part of the toddler repertoire, temper tantrums can be distressing to parents. When they occur infrequently, tantrums aren\\'t a big deal and are best ignored. It\\'s when they become regular or intense that parents need to look into what\\'s causing them and find ways to stop them. ', \" Some children are more prone to tantrums, particularly kids who are intense, hyperactive, or moody, or kids who don't adapt well to new environments. For most toddlers, tantrums are simply a way of getting out their frustration and testing limits (Will mommy buy me that toy if I scream really loud?).  The smallest things, from asking them to take a bath while they're in the middle of watching Sesame Street to requesting that they share a favorite stuffed animal with a younger sibling, can set off young children. Any situation that involves change may spawn a tantrum. Add fatigue or hunger to the equation and children, their threshold for tolerance even lower, are even more likely to throw a tantrum. \", \" The easiest way to stop a temper tantrum is to give the child what they want. Obviously, that strategy won't do you any good in the long run, because your child will constantly go into tantrum mode whenever they want something.  The first step in defusing a temper tantrum is to keep your own temper in check. You're not going to get anywhere with your child if both of you are screaming at each other. Spanking your child is also not a good option, and it will only make the tantrum worse. Take a deep breath, gain control over your emotions, and then discipline your child by calmly but firmly letting them know that tantrums are not acceptable behavior.  If your child still won't calm down and you know the tantrum is just a ploy to get your attention, don't give in. Even if you have to walk through the supermarket dragging your screaming toddler, just ignore the tantrum. It is easier said than done, but stick to your guns and eventually the duration will lessen and they will know you are serious and this is not going to work. Once your child realizes the temper tantrum isn't getting them anywhere, they'll stop screaming.  If your child is upset to the point of being inconsolable or out of control, hold them tightly to calm them down. Tell them gently that you love them but that you're not going to give them what they want. If that doesn't work, remove them from the situation and put them in a time-out for a minute or two to give them time to calm down. The general guideline for the length of a time-out is one minute per year of the child's age.  It’s also OK for you to take a break if you feel like you’re losing control. Put your baby in a safe spot, like a crib or playpen, and take a few minutes to regroup. Go into another room and listen to music, call a friend, or do something relaxing. \", \" Instead of having to stop a temper tantrum after it starts, prevent it by following these tips:  Avoid situations in which tantrums are likely to erupt. Try to keep your daily routines as consistent as possible and give your child a five-minute warning before changing activities.  Communicate with your toddler. Don't underestimate their ability to understand what you are saying. Tell them the plan for the day and stick to your routine to minimize surprises.  Allow your child to take a toy or food item with them while you run errands. It may help them stay occupied.  Make sure your child is well rested and fed before you go out so they don't blow up at the slightest provocation.  Put away off-limit temptations (for example, don't leave candy bars lying on the kitchen counter close to dinnertime) so they don't lead to battles.  Give your toddler a little bit of control. Let your child choose which book to bring in the car or whether they want grilled cheese or peanut butter and jelly for lunch. These little choices won't make much of a difference to you, but they'll make your child feel as though they have at least some control over their own life.  Pick your battles. Sometimes you can give in a little, especially when it comes to small things. Would you rather let your child watch 15 extra minutes of television or listen\\xa0them scream for 30 minutes?  Distract. A young child's attention is fleeting and easy to divert. When your child's face starts to crinkle and redden in that telltale way, open a book or offer to go on a walk to the park before it can escalate into a full-blown tantrum. Sometimes, humor is the best way to distract. Make a funny face, tell a joke, or start a pillow fight to get your child's mind off what's upsetting them.  Teach your child other ways of dealing with frustration. Children who are old enough to talk can be reminded to use their words instead of screaming.  Praise your child for getting it right. When they stay cool in a situation that would normally have triggered a tantrum, tell them they did a good job of controlling their temper. Even when you discipline your baby, be sure to let them know that you love them no matter what. Positive comments help boost self-esteem.  If temper tantrums are becoming more frequent, they haven't stopped by around age 4, or your child is in danger of hurting them or others, it's time to call your child's health care provider. \", ' SOURCES:  National Association of School Psychologists: \"Temper Tantrums: Guidelines for Parents.\"  KidsHealth: \"Temper Tantrums,\"\\xa0\"Nine Steps to More Effective Parenting.\"  The Ohio State University Extension: \"Temper Tantrums.\"  University of Virginia Health System: \"Temper Tantrums.\"  Mayo Clinic: \"Parenting tips: How to improve toddler behavior.\" ', ' Toddler Milestones  Child Development  Behavior & Discipline  Child Safety  Healthy Habits  All Guide Topics ', ' How to Discipline Kids Without Spanking  7 Signs You Might Be a Helicopter Parent  What to Do About Bedwetting  Crazy Things Teens Use to Get High  Gross Things Kids Do  When Your Child Has Migraines ', \" Toddler Milestones -- Your Child's Second Year of Development  Childhood Illnesses Every Parent Should Know  How Safe Is Junior at Play?

If they aren't, ask your pediatrician.  Toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of sleep.  Kids who wake up groggy aren't sleeping enough.  After chasing your toddler around the house and yard all day, your child's naptime is a well-deserved luxury for you. It's a chance for you to catch up with friends, read, or just rest.  Your Toddler's Development This Month  If it seems like your toddler is into everything, it's because they are. Their hand-eye coordination is getting more precise every day, letting them pick up, throw, and fit objects together.  Fifteen-month-olds explore with their hands by:  Turning dials and knobs  Stacking blocks and knocking them over  Putting toys into holes or boxes  Rolling balls  It's up to you to make sure those curious hands don't wander into something dangerous, like an open outlet or hot oven.  Right now your child is exploring equally with both hands. By the end of their second year, they may start to favor the right or left hand. \", \" Establish a nightly bedtime routine. Start with a warm bath followed by a soothing story and some cuddle time.  At this age, it's OK to let your child cry it out in their crib for a little while -- after you've determined that they aren't sick, hungry, or uncomfortable.  Encourage downtime by putting your child in a quiet, dark room and turning on soothing music.  Give your child toys that help them learn how things fit together, such as easy puzzles and shapes sorters.  Make sure your child gets enough calcium needed for strong bones by giving them plenty of milk, yogurt, and cheese.  Watch out for foods that can choke a toddler, like grapes, popcorn, hard candies, and hot dogs. Cut foods into small pieces that are easy for your child to manage.  Chasing after a toddler all day can really wear you out! Make sure you set aside time to recharge. \", ' SOURCES:  About Kids Health: \"Growing Consequences of Not Enough Sleep.\"  American Academy of Pediatrics: \"Hand and Finger Skills: 1 Year Olds.\"  American Academy of Pediatrics: \"Calcium Crisis.\"  American Academy of Pediatrics: \"Feeding and Nutrition: Your One-Year-Old.\" ', ' Toddler Milestones  Child Development  Behavior & Discipline  Child Safety  Healthy Habits  All Guide Topics ', ' How to Discipline Kids Without Spanking  7 Signs You Might Be a Helicopter Parent  What to Do About Bedwetting  Crazy Things Teens Use to Get High  Gross Things Kids Do  When Your Child Has Migraines ', \" Video: Installing a Toddler's Car Set  What to Know About Potty Training  What Is 'Transitioning'?

The same is also true for what comes out of your mouth. Toddlers may repeat anything you say.  A toddler\\'s natural urge to mimic can be a good thing. Repeat a few new words to them each day, and they\\'ll pick them up right away.  But copycatting can also backfire. Stub your toe and yell, \"S%$t!\" and you\\'re bound to hear the word pop out of your child\\'s mouth at some point.  Be careful not only about what you say but also about what your friends say in front of your child. Filter TV shows, radio shows, and music your child is exposed to, even if it\\'s just playing in the background. If it\\'s within earshot, it\\'s fair game for your child\\'s ears.  Your Toddler\\'s Development This Month  Each toddler is a unique little person. They don\\'t act the same -- or look the same -- as any other child their age.  Your child also grows at a different pace than their peers. They may tower over all of their friends or lag a little behind them in height. Your child\\'s growth chart -- kept up by your pediatrician -- keeps track of all that.  You\\'re probably very familiar with growth charts by now. Here\\'s a reminder of what they\\'re used for:  Measuring your child\\'s height, weight, and head circumference  Comparing their weight and height with the measurements of other kids their age  Tracking their height and weight as a percentile; if their weight is in the 50th percentile, it means 50% of kids their age weigh more than them, and 50% weigh less.  Helping your doctor track your child\\'s growth over time, to look for any sudden spurts or lags ', \" Did your toddler say something you don't approve of? Don't act shocked or make a big fuss. Ignoring it may help make it stop, because it doesn't get attention.  When it comes to food, go for healthy fare: grilled chicken instead of fried, fruit instead of French fries, and never soda. You can't force them to eat what you serve, but don't succumb to giving them junk just so they eat. Be a good role model with this, too.  When a toddler has an earache, they may let you know by pulling on their ear and being more irritable than usual. See the doctor -- if it's an infection, they may need an antibiotic.  Your child is due for their next checkup next month, at their 2nd birthday. Bring a list of questions to ask the pediatrician about their growth, development, and behavior.  Is your toddler a budding artist? Encourage their creativity by giving their crayons, sculpting dough, and washable paints to make their masterpieces.  If you do take your toddler for a swim in the pool, put a waterproof diaper on them\\xa0and change it promptly afterwards. Don't forget sunscreen.  Check in with your significant other while your child sleeps. Talk over your concerns -- and your joys. You're in this together. Single? Take the same time to call a friend. \", ' SOURCES:  AboutKidsHealth: \"Fast Foods: Better Choices.\"  American Academy of Family Physicians: \"Earaches in Children.\"  American Academy of Pediatrics: \"Well-Child-Care -- A Check-Up for Success.\"  Nemours Foundation: \"Growth Charts;\" \"Water Safety;\" and \"How Becoming Parents Can Affect Your Relationship.\" ', ' Toddler Milestones  Child Development  Behavior & Discipline  Child Safety  Healthy Habits  All Guide Topics ', ' How to Discipline Kids Without Spanking  7 Signs You Might Be a Helicopter Parent  What to Do About Bedwetting  Crazy Things Teens Use to Get High  Gross Things Kids Do  When Your Child Has Migraines ', \" Video: Installing a Toddler's Car Set  What to Know About Potty Training  What Is 'Transitioning'?

All of a sudden, you may start seeing behaviors like:  Screaming  Temper tantrums  Kicking and biting  Fighting with siblings  Total meltdowns  It\\'s the \"terrible 2s.\" Your child\\'s behavior is a way of expressing their need for independence along with their frustration at not being in control all the time.  This trying time will pass. Teach your child phrases such as “My turn please” and encourage them to express themselves while staying calm and using their words and not their fists. In the meantime, deal with meltdowns by being patient but firm and maintaining a consistent routine. Remember, you\\'re the adult.  Your Toddler\\'s Development This Month  Meals aren\\'t always enough to satisfy a hungry toddler, especially a picky eater.  Your child needs 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day. That includes meals and two to three snacks.  Not every snack is equally healthy. Eating too many fatty or sugary treats or drinking more than 4 ounces of juice daily can lead to obesity. Extra-large portions can also be a problem. A toddler-sized snack is only about half a cup of cereal or crackers.  Here are some healthy snack ideas:  Sliced strawberries or apple  Whole-wheat crackers  Small pieces of cheese  Applesauce  Low-fat yogurt (watch the added sugar -- some are loaded with it)  Half a cup of low-fat milk  Foods that are high in fiber and protein will keep your toddler full, so they won\\'t be begging for another snack an hour later. It\\'s also a good time to start shifting to a lower-fat diet.  Your child is still growing, but not as fast as newborns do, so it\\'s normal for 2-year-olds to not eat quite so much or be a little less interested in eating a variety of foods.  But remember, your child may not accept a new food until they\\'ve seen it 10 times. So keep letting your child try new foods, but without pressure. Never turn meal time into a battle. ', ' No matter how bad the tantrums get, keep your cool. Take a deep breath, leave the room, and regroup so you can calmly deal with the behavior.  Don\\'t schedule outings or activities at times when you know your child is most likely to fall apart -- usually near nap time or meal time.  Your child may still be taking a 1- to 3-hour nap each day. Don\\'t schedule naps too close to bedtime or they\\'ll have trouble falling asleep at night.  Some kids suddenly wake up screaming in the night. To prevent these \"night terrors,\" make sure your child gets enough sleep and isn\\'t overtired.  Coughing is normal in toddlers, but if a cough lasts for more than a couple of weeks, it could be an infection, allergies, or asthma. See your pediatrician.  Don\\'t let your child sit around for more than an hour at a time (unless they\\'re sleeping). Get them up, outside, and moving!  Cut their food into pieces they can handle and avoid round candy, popcorn, or hot dogs that could pose a choking or gagging hazard.

Horrified, you rush to discipline your pint-sized vampire -- but what's the best way to handle the situation?  Biting is a normal part of childhood development. Young children bite for many different reasons, from teething to seeing what reaction it will provoke. Many children between ages 1 and 3 go through a biting phase, which they eventually outgrow.  Still, biting is something you want to discourage. Fortunately, there are ways to dissuade your little chomper from sinking their\\xa0teeth into everything that walks and talks. \", \" Kids bite for a number of reasons -- and most of them aren't intentionally malicious.  They're in pain. When babies bite, typically it's because they're teething. They're just doing it to relieve the pain of their swollen, tender gums.  They're exploring their world. Very young children use their mouths to explore, just as they use their hands. Just about everything infants or toddlers pick up eventually winds up in their mouths. Kids this age aren't yet able to prevent themselves from biting the object of their interest.  They're looking for a reaction. Part of exploration is curiosity. Toddlers experiment to see what kind of reaction their actions will provoke. They'll bite down on a friend or sibling to hear the surprised exclamation, not realizing how painful the experience is for that person.  They're craving attention. In older kids, biting is just one of several bad behaviors used to get attention. When a child feels ignored, discipline is at least one way of getting noticed -- even if the attention is negative rather than positive.  They're frustrated. Biting, like hitting, is a way for some children to assert themselves when they're still too young to express feelings effectively through words. To your child, biting is a way to get back a favorite toy, tell you that they are unhappy, or let another child know that they want to be left alone. \", ' Practice prevention so that your child will be less likely to bite in the first place.  If your baby is teething, make sure to always have a cool teething ring or washcloth on hand so they will be less likely to sink teeth into someone\\'s arm.  Avoid situations in which your child can get irritable enough to bite. Make sure that all of your child\\'s needs -- including eating and nap time -- are taken care of before you go out to play. Bring along a snack to soothe your child if they get cranky from being hungry.  As soon as your child is old enough, encourage the use of words (\"I\\'m angry with you\" or \"That\\'s my toy\") instead of biting. Other ways to express frustration or anger include hugging a stuffed animal or punching a pillow. Sometimes, shortening activities or giving your child a break can help prevent the rising frustration that can lead to biting and other bad behaviors.  Give your child enough of your time throughout the day (for example, by reading or playing together), so they don\\'t bite just to get attention. Extra attention is especially important when your child is going through a major life change, such as a move or welcoming a baby sibling. If your child is prone to biting, keep an eye on any playmates and step in when an altercation appears to be brewing.  Even with your best prevention efforts, biting incidents might still occur. When your child bites, firmly let your child know that this behavior is not acceptable by saying, \"No. We don\\'t bite!\" Explain that biting hurts the other person. Then remove your child from the situation and give the child time to calm down.  You might have heard from other parents that if your child bites you, bite your child back. This isn\\'t good advice. Children learn by imitation. If you bite your child, the child is going to get the impression that this behavior is acceptable and they will be more likely to do it again. The same goes for hitting a child for biting.  If you are unable to get your child to stop biting, the behavior could begin to have an impact on school and relationships. You or another adult might have to closely supervise interactions between your child and other kids. When biting becomes a habit or continues past age 4 or 5, it might stem from a more serious emotional problem. Talk to your child\\'s health care provider, or enlist the help of a child psychologist or therapist. ', \" The first thing to do for any biting injury is to wash the area with soap and water. Even little teeth can break the skin. If the bite is bleeding and the wound appears to be deep, call your child's doctor. The bite may need medical treatment, which could include antibiotics or a tetanus shot, or both. \", ' SOURCES:  Iowa State University: \"Biting.\"  American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons: \"Human Bites.\"  Missouri Families.org: \"What to Do About Biting?\"  American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry: \"Fighting and Biting.\"  University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension: \"When a Child Bites.\" ', ' How to Discipline Kids Without Spanking  7 Signs You Might Be a Helicopter Parent  What to Do About Bedwetting  Crazy Things Teens Use to Get High  Gross Things Kids Do  When Your Child Has Migraines ', ' Printable Good Behavior Awards for Kids  The Hyperactive Child  Cutting & Self-Harm: Warning Signs and Treatment  Rite of Passage or Cry for Help?

If your child wets the bed, they are not alone.  Although most children are toilet trained between 2 and 4 years of age, some children may not be able to stay dry at night until they are older. Children develop at their own rate. For example, studies have shown that 15% of 5- and 7-year-olds wet the bed. But by age 15, fewer than 1%wet the bed.  Bedwetting is not a serious medical condition, but it can be a challenging problem for children and parents. Read on to find out more about bedwetting and what\\xa0families can do about it. ', \" Here are 3 common reasons for bedwetting:  Communication between the brain and bladder. If the bladder signals the brain that it's filling up with urine—and the brain doesn't send a message back to the bladder to relax and hold the urine until morning—bedwetting will happen. Likewise, if the bladder signals the brain that it's filling up with urine and the brain doesn't hear the signals, especially during deep sleep, bedwetting will happen.

Rarely, some children begin to wet the bed as a result of a serious medical problem. \", \" Most children wet their beds during toilet training. Even after they stay dry at night for a number of days or even weeks, they may start wetting at night again. If this happens to your child, simply go back to training pants at night and try again another time. The problem usually disappears as children get older. If children reach school age and still have problems wetting the bed, it most likely means they have never developed nighttime bladder control.  If you are concerned about your child's bedwetting or your child expresses concern, talk with your child's doctor. You may be asked the following questions about your child's bedwetting:  Is there a family history of bedwetting?  Is there a family history of bedwetting?

When used correctly, it will detect wetness right away and sound the alarm.  Bedwetting alarms are successful 50% to 75% of the time. They tend to be most helpful for children who are deep sleepers and have some bladder control on their own. Ask your child's doctor which type of alarm may be best for your child. \", \" Medicines are available to treat bedwetting for children 6 years and older. Though medicines rarely cure bedwetting, they may be helpful—\\u200bespecially when children begin attending sleepovers or overnight camps. Your child's doctor can tell you more about these medicines and if they are right for your child.

First, you had to locate the stick shift, the clutch pedal, and the gears. Next, you had to get a feel for when it was time to shift gears, and learn how to do so smoothly while easing the clutch pedal down and up again.  During the toilet-training process, your child must learn to coordinate an equally complex combination of physical and cognitive tasks. She must familiarize herself with the necessary “equipment” (her body and its functions), associate physical sensations with the proper responses, picture what she wants to do (use the potty), create a plan to get there, begin using it, and remain in place long enough to finish, which requires both memory and concentration. Throughout this learning process, she must be able to understand your explanations, commands, and responses to some extent, and express her own feelings about toilet use. ', ' Clearly, all of this learning takes time. The first steps in this process involve bodily sensation—the ability to associate an inner feeling of fullness with the bowel movement or urination that results—and usually take place at around twelve to eighteen months. Your efforts to reinforce this awareness by remarking on the poop or pee to come are among the first productive actions you can take to start your child thinking about potty use.  As time passes, your child may demonstrate discomfort over a dirty diaper, try to remove her diaper or resist being diapered, and otherwise show that her awareness of her physical state is expanding. She may start to enjoy (and even insist on) spending a substantial amount of time without clothes on, and by age two will have become quite interested in all of her body parts, especially the “private” ones used to eliminate. This is the age when boys commonly begin to talk about their penis, or comment on Dad’s, while girls start to explore and ask questions about the vagina and its uses. Such interest in the body indicates a new openness to your explanations of how the body works and a desire to “name the equipment.” Acquiring simple words to describe her body and its workings helps your child think more fully about the process of elimination. It also sets the stage for learning through experience. Just letting her sit on the potty until she happens to have a bowel movement—and then hearing you say how pleased you are by what she did—is likely to help your child connect the need to poop with potty use more effectively than any long-winded explanation. ', ' Understanding the link between needing to eliminate and doing so is an important first step in toilet training readiness. Still, more development is necessary before your child can begin picturing the potty when she needs to go,\\xa0plan how she will get to the bathroom and urinate into the potty, and remember her plan long enough to carry it out. These next steps in the developmental process\\xa0require the capacity for picturing actions (symbolic thought), planning (problem solving), and memory—abilities that begin to surface at age one but become much better established by age two or even later.  One of the first signs that your child is able to think of an object when it isn’t there, for example, is at around twelve months, when she begins to wail every time you leave the room. For the first time, she can picture you and know that you continue to exist even though she can’t get to you, and it is the frustration caused by this understanding that makes her cry. In the coming months, her brain will develop to the point where she realizes she can crawl or toddle to the next room to find you—and walk to the bathroom to find her potty.  By age two, she may routinely picture her potty when she needs to use the bathroom. She may even know how to find the potty when she wants to. She may still need your support, however, in making the associations required to decide to go to the potty when she feels the urge and accomplishing her mission before other thoughts or events distract her.  By age two and a half or three, your child’s evolving interest in problem solving will support her ability to accomplish this series of actions on her own. Solving problems requires picturing a solution and planning a way to achieve it, and seeing these skills develop is perhaps one of the most pleasurable ways of noting that your child is approaching toilet-training readiness. As your child moves from her second to her third birthday, you will be able to observe her solving problems over and over, all day long—from how to get her toy shovel back from another child in the sandbox to how to get you to give her an extra piece of candy after dinner. The sight of your child’s pensive face, pondering how she will obtain the current object of her desire, is a sure sign that she is also cognitively mature enough to figure out how to solve the problem of staying dry without diapers (go to the bathroom and sit on the potty—now!). ', ' \\u200bA number of other cognitive developments greatly facilitate your child’s ability to use the potty successfully beginning at around age two and a half or three. Her memory will have improved a great deal, enabling her not only to remember where she is headed when she starts toward the bathroom but to recall previous toilet-training experiences and benefit from them. Her imagination has expanded, allowing her to explore potty use through imaginary play with stuffed animals, dolls, and puppets. (An expanded imagination may also create new problems in toilet training, leading to such anxieties as the fear of a flushing toilet or the fear of being flushed away.)  By age three she will have grown somewhat better at interrupting her focus on another task to go to the bathroom and resist distraction on the way. Chances are she will have achieved the verbal sophistication necessary, too, to communicate any problems or confusion she is experiencing, to express any fears that may have developed, and to ask for adults’ help and guidance when she needs it.  These essential cognitive and verbal developments, just as important to toilet training success as physiological growth, are the reason why most parents find that waiting until age two and a half or three to begin training usually makes the process much easier. Particularly if you have begun laying the groundwork at an earlier age, waiting for your child’s natural development to fall into place can be a wise decision.

', \" Having potty-training plan for your child and knowing the best time to start it can make the toilet training process go more smoothly. But there are certain universal rules relating to toilet training—as well as to other aspects of parenting—that will enhance your family's experience no matter what method you choose. Some important points to remember:  Be positive. Children learn best when they are praised for their progress rather than punished for their mistakes. Do what you can to help your child succeed as often as possible—even if it means learning gradually, one tiny step at a time. When they progress, give them a hug, some praise, and perhaps even a small tangible reward. When they fails, tell them you're sure they'll do better next time and ask them to help you clean up.

When they progress, give them a hug, some praise, and perhaps even a small tangible reward. When they fails, tell them you're sure they'll do better next time and ask them to help you clean up.  Try to be as consistent as possible. Create reasonable expectations according to your child's abilities, express them clearly and frequently, and expect your child to at least try to follow them every time. Keep their bathroom routine as consistent as possible, with their potty in the same place every day and the sequence of actions—including wiping and hand washing—the same every time. While they are toilet-training, praise your child for each success, and provide predictable, nonpunitive consequences (such as helping to clean up) for each failure. Make sure that your approach to toilet training is consistent with those of your child's other caregivers as well.  Try to be as consistent as possible.

Toilet-training approaches that worked two weeks ago may not work today, and skills that your child mastered in the past may temporarily disappear in the face of new challenges. Continue to monitor your child's bathroom behavior throughout toilet training and afterward so that you can quickly identify and resolve any new problems that arise.  Stay involved and observe.

It doesn't take a great deal of effort to figure out whether your child is more a talker or a doer, or a lover of adult-imposed routine or an independent soul who prefers to control their own actions. In the process of figuring that out, you and your child will have go\\u200btten to know each other better.

Behaviors such as defecating (pooping) in a corner of the bedroom, having daily accidents at school after many months of complete dryness, or pleading to return to diapers are disturbing and even frightening to many parents—more so when they do not understand the cause.  Once physical causes have been ruled out, however, the reasons behind many of these behaviors can be unearthed by considering any changes in your child’s life or emotional development, observing thier other behaviors and listening carefully to what they say. ', \" A major change in a child's life can cause them to regress during toilet training. Regression can occur for similar reasons long after toilet training. A new baby in the family, a move to a new home, family conflict, or any other emotionally stressful situation may cause your child to revert to an earlier level of bathroom mastery. This may involve \\r bedwetting, puddling, withholding of stool and even pooping in inappropriate places. Inner stress prompted by your child’s normal development can affect her bathroom behaviors as well. \", ' Other feelings and emotional situations can overwhelm your young child and cause them to behave in ways that seem puzzling at first. A desire for more attention may cause them to stage more accidents just to engage you in conversation or emotional interaction. If they feel you have been too controlling about bathroom use—constantly asking if they need to go instead of letting them direct their own behavior—they may resist going until it’s too late and they have an accident instead.  A more active imagination and a tendency toward magical thinking may cause them to fear the toilet and start to avoid it. Even a desire to befriend another child by imitating them can lead to regressive bathroom behavior if the other child is not toilet-trained. Finally, a temporary wish to return to coddled babyhood, which nearly all young children experience at some time, may prompt your child to ask you if they can start wearing diapers again. ', ' For toilet-trained children, as well as for those still being trained, regression in bathroom use usually does not last long. Respond calmly and use it as an opportunity to support and communicate with your child. Help your child identify the problem, sympathize with their feelings, and help them find practical solutions. Such evidence of your support and understanding will help her to relax and eventually move forward.  Meanwhile, try to avoid major concessions such as returning to diapers. Instead, consider offering to put them in training pants under their underwear for a while, put the potty in their room, accompany them to the preschool bathroom before the school day begins, or otherwise compromise until they feel more secure.

', ' Bathroom humor, or potty talk, commonly accompanies toilet training and preschool development in general. Three-and four-year-olds become interested in these words as they hear them increasingly from you during toilet training or from their friends during play. Not only do these new terms seem to hold the key to the puzzle of how their bodies work and why boys and girls differ—two issues that fascinate them at this age—but they offer the added punch of terrific shock value. Saying “poopy-head” is bound to get a strong reaction from you and plenty of laughter from your daughter’s friends. What preschooler could resist such a word? ', ' You can discourage this behavior by taking care not to overreact to it. If your child gets no shocked response, using the words is not as fun. Calmly acknowledge her motive for using such terms (“That word sounds funny to you, huh?”), then redirect her attention (“I know a good joke. Listen to this . . .”).  It is not too soon, also, to start teaching your child that certain behavior is appropriate in some situations but not in others (“Talk about bathroom stuff with Mom and Dad, not with your brother’s friends.”). As long as you don’t expect perfect results right away and don’t focus too intensely on this issue, it will pass.

', ' Some problematic toilet behaviors have physical origins. Others are caused by anxiety or other overwhelming emotions. Many behaviors, however, are quite typical expressions of a normal child’s ongoing cognitive development.  The younger toddler’s ability to comprehend and respond to the body’s signals was noted as a necessary development before toilet training should be attempted. Further developments that manifest over time can support or sabotage bathroom habits—and, in some cases, do both. Forgetfulness and distractibility continue to challenge children, whose memory capacity is still limited—particularly when a lot is happening or things are changing in their lives. Difficulty breaking focus in time to get to the bathroom leads to accidents as well.  Toddlers’ and preschoolers’ cognitive growth allows them to think more about and test the limits parents impose—leading to deliberate violations of bathroom routines. Finally, while preschoolers’ greatly expanded imagination helps them think and learn about toilet use through play, it can lead to resistance as children imagine disaster looming each time the toilet is flushed. Enhanced imagination is also responsible for such “magical-thinking” practices as depositing stool in strange places, avoiding certain bathrooms or insisting on using only one particular potty, refusing to flush the toilet or flushing a ritual number of times, and so on.  Strange as some of these behaviors can appear to adults, they are perfectly reasonable from a child’s point of view. Again, there is no point in criticizing your child for behavior he cannot help. In some cases, particularly those involving confusion about toilet use, a series of brief, thoughtful\\xa0conversations may ease the situation.  At other times, as when bathroom practices are violated as a way of testing boundaries, it’s important to reinstate your rules and stand firmly behind them. As in the other instances described, your knowledge of your particular child remains your best tool in deciding how to respond. As long as your child knows that you support his efforts but that you expect him to return soon to correct bathroom behavior, the two of you will eventually reach your goal.

', ' One of the most difficult aspects of toilet training for many parents is the uneven pace at which different types of training occur. Your child may learn to urinate into a potty quite easily but take several more months to start having bowel movements there. Daytime training may have been a breeze for your toddler, but he continues to wet the bed frequently through age five.  Since the order and speed with which each of these skills is mastered may differ from child to child, it is impossible to compare one child’s mastery with another’s to determine whether your child’s progress is “normal.” In most cases, the best response to uneven adoption of skills is to remain patient and supportive, giving your child the time he needs to take the next step toward complete success.  Delays in bowel control can be particularly disturbing for many parents, however—especially when children exhibit such puzzling behavior as secretly depositing bowel movements in a closet or other hiding place, smearing feces on the wall or other surface, or bursting into tears when their stool is flushed down the toilet. Our own adult associations with bowel movements are so negative that it is hard to remember that very young children have little awareness of the presence of germs, the potential for mess, the attached cultural stigma, and so on.  On the contrary, toddlers and preschoolers are often extremely proud of the product their bodies have created—expecting praise and admiration, not displeasure—and are reluctant or even anxious at the prospect of letting these products go. This reluctance can grow even stronger during periods when mastery of their body or privacy becomes a high-priority issue in their lives, or when they are experiencing a fear of the potty or of some other aspect of bowel training that they are unable to articulate.  In most cases, hiding or playing with stool, or resistance to bowel training, is a normal part of early childhood that will soon pass if you do not respond to it in an overemotional way. Instead, calmly ask your child why he is behaving in this way, firmly remind him of the rules about where stool goes, and work to come up with a solution to his problem—preferably with his help. You may find that your child is more willing to deposit his stool in the potty if he is then allowed to transfer it to the toilet and flush it himself. You may decide that it is necessary to monitor your child’s potty use until his interest in playing with his stools has passed.  In many cases, when your child’s health or other important considerations are not at stake, you may find that the best solution is to simply wait until your child matures. If so, you may find that what at first seemed an enormous gap between bladder and bowel training actually turned out to be no more than three or four weeks.  While nighttime bowel control occurs quite early and naturally in most children, bladder control usually occurs much later—frequently months or even years after daytime training is complete—and requires conscious effort. Forty percent of children in this country continue to wet the bed while sleeping after they have been fully day-trained. Bedwetting continues to be quite common through age five, and it usually does not require medical intervention until age eight to ten. Many children under age six are not physiologically capable of remaining dry at night, since their bladders have not sufficiently matured and their bodies may not yet consistently wake them from sleep when it’s time to urinate. Nearly every child will experience at least a few nighttime bedwettings before the toilet-training process is truly complete.  Since conflicts over such mishaps can easily spill over to cause resistance during the day, it is usually best to downplay night training through the toddler and even perhaps the preschool years. If your child is capable of consistently waking up to use the bathroom even at age two or three, count yourself lucky and allow him to do so. If accidents occur frequently, try keeping him in training pants or even a diaper at night for as long as he feels comfortable in them, and respond calmly to any accidents that occur.

', ' Just as everyone has a different opinion about when it’s best to begin toilet training, so every parent you know is likely to use or recommend a different training method.  You may have heard that demonstrating toilet use for your child is a good way to help him learn through imitation. A friend may have told you that all she had to do with her son was read him a book about potty use and talk it over with him. Many parents recommend talking with their children about toilet use and then asking every two hours, “Do you need to go?” Some feel that rewarding a child with gold stars on a chart or a small treat is the most effective method. Timing is also a factor, as some parents prefer a brief, concentrated approach (perhaps even taking time off from work to deliver two weeks of “immersion training”), while others feel that their children are less pressured when allowed to adjust to potty use gradually over many months.  Any of these techniques may work well with your child. But keep in mind that it is not necessary to choose a single method—in fact, your child will benefit from a combination of verbal, physical, social, and other forms of training no matter what his age.  Accepting and adjusting to your child’s personal style can make toilet training a much less stressful experience than you may have expected. You may also find yourself getting to know your child in a way you didn’t before—appreciating his special qualities, becoming familiar with his emerging interests, and respecting him as a unique, interesting individual.

', ' Picky eating is often the norm for toddlers. After the rapid growth of infancy, when babies usually triple in weight, a toddler’s growth rate – and appetite – tends to slow down.  Toddlers also are beginning to develop food preferences, a fickle process. A toddler’s favorite food one day may hit the floor the next, or a snubbed food might suddenly become the one he or she can’t get enough of. For weeks, they may eat 1 or 2 preferred foods – and\\xa0nothing else.  Try not to get frustrated by this typical toddler behavior. Just make healthy food choices available and know that, with time, your child\\'s appetite and eating behaviors will level out. In the meantime, here are some tips that can help you get through the picky eater stage.  1. Family style. Share a meal together as a family as often as you can. This means no\\xa0media distractions like TV or cell phones at mealtime.\\xa0Use this time to model healthy eating. Serve one meal for the whole family and resist the urge to make another meal if your child refuses what you\\'ve served. This only encourages picky eating. Try to include at least one food your child likes with each meal and continue to provide a balanced meal, whether she eats it or not.  2. Food fights. If your toddler refuses a meal, avoid fussing over it. It’s good for children to learn to listen to their bodies and use hunger as a guide. If they ate a big breakfast or lunch, for example, they may not be interested in eating much the rest of the day. It\\'s a parent\\'s responsibility to provide food, and the child’s decision to eat it. Pressuring kids to eat, or punishing them if they don\\'t, can make them actively dislike foods they may otherwise like.  3. Break from bribes. Tempting as it may be, try not to bribe your children with treats for eating other foods. This can make the \"prize\" food even more exciting, and the food you want them to try an unpleasant chore. It also can lead to nightly battles at the dinner table.  4. Try, try again. Just because a child refuses a food once, don\\'t give up. Keep offering new foods and those your child didn\\'t like before. It can take as many as 10 or more times tasting a food before a toddler’s taste buds accept it. Scheduled meals and limiting snacks can help ensure your child is hungry when a new food is introduced.  5. Variety: the spice. Offer a variety of healthy foods, especially vegetables and fruits, and include higher protein foods like meat and deboned fish at least 2 times per week. Help your child explore new flavors and textures in food. Try adding different herbs and spices to simple meals to make them tastier. To minimize waste, offer new foods in small amounts and wait at least a week or two before reintroducing the same food.  6. Make food fun. Toddlers are especially open to trying foods arranged in eye-catching, creative ways. Make foods look irresistible by arranging them in fun, colorful shapes kids can recognize. Kids this age also tend to enjoy any food involving a dip.\\xa0Finger foods are also usually a hit with toddlers. Cut solid foods into bite size pieces they can easily eat themselves, making sure the pieces are small enough to avoid the risk of choking.  7. Involve kids in meal planning. Put your toddler\\'s growing interest in exercising control to good use. Let you child pick which\\xa0fruit and vegetable to make for dinner or during visits to the grocery store or farmer\\'s market. Read kid-friendly cookbooks together and let your child pick out new recipes to try.  8. Tiny chefs. Some cooking tasks are perfect for toddlers (with lots of supervision, of course): sifting, stirring, counting ingredients, picking fresh herbs from a garden or windowsill, and “painting” on cooking oil with a pastry brush, to name a few.  9. Crossing bridges.\\xa0 Once a food is accepted, use what nutritionists call \"food bridges\" to introduce others with similar color, flavor and texture to help expand variety in what your child will eat.\\xa0If your child likes pumpkin pie, for example, try mashed sweet potatoes and then mashed carrots.  10. A fine pair. Try serving unfamiliar foods, or flavors young children tend to dislike at first (sour and bitter), with familiar foods toddlers naturally prefer (sweet and salty). Pairing broccoli (bitter) with grated cheese (salty), for example, is a great combination for toddler taste buds. ', ' If you are concerned about your child’s diet, talk with your pediatrician, who can help troubleshoot and make sure your child is getting all the necessary nutrients to grow and develop. Also keep in mind that picky eating usually is a normal developmental stage for toddlers. Do your best to patiently guide them on their path toward healthy eating.

If you’ve ever tried to get your child to eat without all the success you’d hoped for, this new book may be just what you need.  As the mother of a 22-month-old boy who has discovered the power of stating his dining opinions firmly, I couldn’t have received more timely support than that of my latest read, Food Fights: Winning the Nutritional Challenges of Parenthood Armed with Insights, Humor, and a Bottle of Ketchup, by Laura A. Jana, M.D., FAAP, and Jennifer Shu, M.D., FAAP, and published by the AAP.  Readers are likely to have the same sentiment regardless of their child’s age. After all, feeding one’s children is an ongoing responsibility of parenthood that often becomes complicated by stage-specific needs — and that in addition to a mountain of well-intentioned advice and government recommendations.  A quick search on “child nutrition” at Amazon.com Books finds\\xa0more than 4,700 results. Pediatricians Jana and Shu know that despite being exposed to all that information, we are still left with questions. Fortunately, they have practical, reality-based answers. ', ' \"It is impossible to ignore the fact that food-related battles rank right at the top of the daily list of parental challenges,” write the co-authors. They let you know right away that they mean business, but they do it with the kind of encouragement that you hope to gain from bonding with fellow parents.  Barely into the first chapter of Food Fights, one sure statement is enough to convince you:  “With some basic insights along with some palatable peacekeeping strategies, you can win the nutritional challenges of parenthood and play a defining role in shaping your child’s lifelong eating habits.”  Thank goodness I resisted the urge to skip the practical advice for the newborn period in lieu of heading straight for more curious matters — such as why “everything tastes better with ketchup.” With plenty of comic relief, Drs. Jana and Shu draw on research, anecdotes, their experiences as pediatricians and mothers, and best practices.  “Reviewing the underlying principles of what you do and what you do for your kids can serve as a powerful way to relate to them. Sometimes people can see it for themselves but not their kids,” says Dr. Jana. ', ' Before delving into the book’s main subject matter, Drs. Jana and Shu present two facts that can often be traced to poor nutritional habits:  Children with obese parents are 80 percent more likely to become obese themselves  30 percent of American adults over the age of 20 are considered obese  Once the idea is introduced, it seems obvious enough that a child wants whatever his or her parents eat. But it’s a great reminder for those of us who become parents believing we’ll become more health-conscious as our baby develops more astute observation skills.  If that’s the case, it is one of the first ways parents are vulnerable to “slippery slopes,” or routines that “ease themselves into existence while we’re too busy going about our parenting business to notice,” as the authors describe it.  “While we had every intention of focusing our\\xa0attention on the questions parents typically ask that are specific to their kids, we constantly found ourselves discussing eating habits in general,” write the authors. “After all, if we as parents can’t get our own eating habits and waistlines under control, how is it that we think we will be able to teach our children to do so?” ', ' “Parents often get themselves into a pattern and don’t know what’s coming or how to make the next transition. We’re giving people a heads-up before they turn what was a good thing into a bad habit,” says Shu. She points out that once these habits are formed, we often admit that if someone had told us ahead of time, we might have done things differently.  Consider some common examples, such as:  Middle-of-the-night feedings  Battles over the bottle  The cure-all status of a sippy-cup  Food Fights introduces 10 “palatable peacekeeping strategies” to keep in mind. Meant as techniques to solve or prevent food-related struggles, the ideas surface throughout the book and illustrate the power of being proactive, rather than reactive. They also provide comfort for parents, who shouldn’t feel that they’re facing this battle alone.  “A lot of principles are the same from age to age,” says Dr. Jana. “Once you extract all the fundamental principles, you can basically apply them to just about any food fight that arises.” ', ' There is a message embedded throughout the book that parents need to hear over and over: Be patient with yourself, be patient with your children. One of the peacekeeping strategies is emphatic on this point: “If at first you don’t succeed … try, try again.” Along with that, another point reminds you “the food pyramid wasn’t built in a day.”  Another solution involves some patience, as well: the “no thank-you” bite, a tried-and-true source of compromise. Studies show that it can take between 10 and 15 tastes of one type of food before a child accepts it or likes it. Offering your child one taste before allowing him or her to refuse a dish adds up toward the desired result.  “Don’t take ‘no’ as a rejection,” says Dr. Jana. “You’re making progress by just exposing your child to new foods and flavors.” ', ' Aside from its focus on the habits of daily eating in addition to the other body functions associated with it, a large section of Food Fights is dedicated to the challenges of eating away from home. This can entail dining with family and friends, at restaurants, and even on a plane.  “If you set the tone with consistency and expectations, children will be more likely to know that you expect them to act that way at somebody else’s house or a restaurant,” says Dr. Shu. “You always have to look at the next step.”  Indeed, Food Fights helps give you the confidence to look ahead to that next step. You don’t need to be daunted by the prospect of reading through every “childhood nutrition” book on the market. An outline of children’s tales recommended in the chapter called “Read All About It!”, however, seems like a much better idea.  Just remember: Your food fights are a battle your entire family can win one bite at a time. Having this timely battle plan in your hands is a great place to start.  \\u200b\\u200b  Contact Us  About Us  Privacy Policy  Terms of Use  Editorial Policy  This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.  ', ' Your three-year-old’s vivid fantasy life will help her explore and come to terms with a wide range of emotions, from love and dependency to anger, protest, and fear. She’ll not only take on various identities herself, but also she’ll often assign living qualities and emotions to inanimate objects, such as a tree, a clock, a truck, or the moon. Ask her why the moon comes out at night, for example, and she might reply, “To say hello to me.”  From time to time, expect your preschooler to introduce you to one of her imaginary friends. Some children have a single make-believe companion for as long as six months; some change pretend playmates every day, while still others never have one at all or prefer imaginary animals instead. Don’t be concerned that these phantom friends may signal loneliness or emotional upset; they’re actually a very creative way for your child to sample different activities, lines of conversation, behavior, and emotions.  You’ll also notice that, throughout the day, your preschooler will move back and forth freely between fantasy and reality. At times she may become so involved in her make-believe world that she can’t tell where it ends and reality begins. Her play experience may even spill over into real life. One night she’ll come to the dinner table convinced she’s Cinderella; another day she may come to you sobbing after hearing a ghost story that she believes is true.  While it’s important to reassure your child when she’s frightened or upset by an imaginary incident, be careful not to belittle or make fun of her. This stage in emotional development is normal and necessary and should not be discouraged. Above all, never joke with her about “locking her up if she doesn’t eat her dinner” or “leaving her behind if she doesn’t hurry up.” She’s liable to believe you and feel terrified the rest of the day—or longer.  From time to time, try to join your child in her fantasy play. By doing so, you can help her find new ways to express her emotions and even work through some problems. For example, you might suggest “sending her doll to school” to see how she feels about going to preschool. Don’t insist on participating in these fantasies, however. Part of the joy of fantasy for her is being able to control these imaginary dramas, so if you plant an idea for make- believe, stand back and let her make of it what she will. If she then asks you to play a part, keep your performance low- key. Let the world of pretend be the one place where she runs the show.  Back in real life; let your preschooler know that you’re proud of her new independence and creativity. Talk with her, listen to what she says, and show her that her opinions matter. Give her choices whenever possible—in the foods she eats, the clothes she wears, and the games you play together. Doing this will give her a sense of importance and help her learn to make decisions. Keep her options simple, however. When you go to a restaurant, for example, narrow her choices down to two or three items. Otherwise she may be overwhelmed and unable to decide. (A trip to an ice- cream store or frozen yogurt shop that sells several flavors can be agonizing if you don’t limit her choices.)  What’s the best approach? Despite what we’ve already said, one of the best ways to nurture her independence is to maintain fairly firm control over all parts of her life, while at the same time giving her some freedom. Let her know that you’re still in charge and that you don’t expect her to make the big decisions. When her friend is daring her to climb a tree, and she’s afraid, it will be comforting to have you say no, so that she doesn’t have to admit her fears. As she conquers many of her early anxieties and becomes more responsible in making her own decisions, you’ll naturally give her more control. In the meantime, it’s important that she feels safe and secure.  Just as it was when he was three, your four-year-old’s fantasy life will remain very active. However, he’s now learning to distinguish between reality and make-believe, and he’ll be able to move back and forth between the two without confusing them as much.  As games of pretend become more advanced, don’t be surprised if children experiment with make-believe games involving some form of violence. War games, dragon-slaying, and even games like tag all fall into this category. Some parents forbid their children to play with store-bought toy guns, only to find them cutting, pasting, and creating cardboard guns or simply pointing a finger and shouting “bang, bang.” Parents shouldn’t panic over these activities. This is no evidence that these children are “violent.” A child has no idea what it is to kill or die. For him, toy guns are an innocent and entertaining way to be competitive and boost his self-esteem.  If you want a gauge of your child’s developing self-confidence, listen to the way he talks to adults. Instead of hanging back, as he may have done at two or three, he now probably is friendly, talkative, and curious. He also is likely to be especially sensitive to the feelings of others—adults and children alike—and to enjoy making people happy. When he sees they’re hurt or sad, he’ll show sympathy and concern. This probably will come out as a desire to hug or “kiss the hurt,” because this is what he most wants when he’s in pain or unhappy.  At about the age of four and five, your preschooler also may begin to show an avid interest in basic sexuality, both his own and that of the opposite sex. He may ask where babies come from and about the organs involved in reproduction and elimination. He may want to know how boys’ and girls’ bodies are different. When confronted with these kinds of questions, answer in simple but correct terminology. A four-year-old, for example, doesn’t need to know the details about intercourse, but he should feel free to ask questions, knowing he’ll receive direct and accurate answers.  Along with this increased interest in sexuality, he’ll probably also play with his own genitals and may even demonstrate an interest in the genitals of other children. These are not adult sexual activities but signs of normal curiosity and don’t warrant scolding or punishment.  At what point should parents set limits on such exploration? This really is a family matter. It’s probably best not to overreact to it at this age, since its normal if done in moderation. However, children need to learn what’s socially appropriate and what’s not. So, for example, you may decide to tell your child:  Interest in genital organs is healthy and natural.  Nudity and sexual play in public are not acceptable.  No other person, including even close friends and relatives, may touch his “private parts.” The exceptions to this rule are doctors and nurses during physical examinations and his own parents when they are trying to find the cause of any pain or discomfort he’s feeling in the genital area.  At about this same time, your child also may become fascinated with the parent of the opposite sex. A four-year-old girl can be expected to compete with her mother for her father’s attention, just as a boy may be vying for his mother’s attention. This so-called oedipal behavior is a normal part of personality development at this age and will disappear in time by itself if the parents take it in stride. There’s no need to feel either threatened or jealous because of it.

They'll also be less dependent on you, a sign that their own sense of identity is stronger and more secure. Now they'll actually play with other children, interacting instead of just playing side by side. In the process, they'll recognize that not everyone thinks exactly as they do and that each of their playmates has many unique qualities, some attractive and some not. You'll also find your child drifting toward certain kids and starting to develop friendships with them. As they create these friendships, children discover that they, too, each have special qualities that make them likable—a revelation that gives a vital boost to self-esteem.  There's some more good news about your child's development at this age: As they become more aware of and sensitive to the feelings and actions of others, they'll gradually stop competing and will learn to cooperate when playing with her friends. They take turns and share toys in small groups, though sometimes they won't. But instead of grabbing, whining, or screaming for something, they'll actually ask politely much of the time. You can look forward to less aggressive behavior and calmer play sessions. Three-year-olds are able to work out solutions to disputes by taking turns or trading toys. \", ' However, particularly in the beginning, you\\'ll need to encourage this cooperation. For instance, you might suggest that they \"use their words\" to deal with problems instead of acting out. Also, remind them that when two children are sharing a toy, each gets an equal turn. Suggest ways to reach a simple solution when your child and another child want the same toy, such as drawing for the first turn or finding another toy or activity. This doesn\\'t work all the time, but it\\'s worth a try. Also, help children with the appropriate words to describe their feelings and desires so that they don\\'t feel frustrated. Above all, show by your own example how to cope peacefully with conflicts. If you have an explosive temper, try to tone down your reactions in their presence. Otherwise, they\\'ll mimic your behavior whenever they\\'re under stress. ', \" No matter what you do, however, there probably will be times when your child's anger or frustration becomes physical. When that happens, restrain them from hurting others, and if they don't calm down quickly, move them away from the other children. Talk to them about her feelings and try to determine why they're so upset. Let them know you understand and accept her feelings, but make it clear that physically attacking another child is not a good way to express these emotions. \", ' Help them see the situation from the other child\\'s point of view by reminding them of a time when someone hit or screamed at them, and then suggest more peaceful ways to resolve their conflicts. Finally, once they understand what they\\'ve done wrong—but not before—ask them to apologize to the other child. However, simply saying \"I\\'m sorry\" may not help your child correct their behavior; they also needs to know why they\\'re apologizing. They may not understand right away, but give it time; by age four these explanations will begin to mean something. ', \" Fortunately, the normal interests of three-year-olds keep fights to a minimum. They spend much of their playtime in fantasy activity, which tends to be more cooperative than play that's focused on toys or games. As you've probably already seen, preschooler enjoy assigning different roles in an elaborate game of make-believe using imaginary or household objects. This type of play helps develop important social skills, such as taking turns, paying attention, communicating (through actions and expressions as well as words), and responding to one another's actions. And there's still another benefit: Because pretend play allows children to slip into any role they wish—including superheroes or the fairy godmother—it also helps them explore more complex social ideas. Plus it helps improve executive functioning such as problem-solving  By watching the role-playing in your child's make-believe games, you may see that they're beginning to identify their own gender and gender identity. While playing house, boys naturally will adopt the father's role and girls the mother's, reflecting whatever they've noticed in the hemworld around them. \", \" Research shows that a few of the developmental and behavioral differences that typically distinguish boys from girls are biologically determined. Most gender-related characteristics at this age are more likely to be shaped by culture and family. Your daughter, for example, may be encouraged to play with dolls by advertisements, gifts from well-meaning relatives, and the approving comments of adults and other children. Boys, meanwhile, may be guided away from dolls in favor of more rough-and-tumble games and sports. Children sense the approval and disapproval and adjust their behavior accordingly. Thus, by the time they enter kindergarten, children's gender identities are often well established.  As children start to think in categories, they often understand the boundaries of these labels without understanding that boundaries can be flexible; children this age often will take this identification process to an extreme. Girls may insist on wearing dresses, nail polish, and makeup to school or to the playground. Boys may swagger, be overly assertive, and carry their favorite ball, bat, or truck everywhere.  On the other hand, some girls and boys reject these stereotypical expressions of gender identity, preferring to choose toys, playmates, interests, mannerisms, and hairstyles that are more often associated with the opposite sex. These children are sometimes called gender expansive, gender variant, gender nonconforming, gender creative, or gender atypical. Among these gender expansive children are some who may come to feel that their deep inner sense of being female or male—their gender identity—is the opposite of their biologic sex, somewhere in between male and female, or another gender; these children are sometimes called transgender\\u200b.  Given that many three-year-old children are doubling down on gender stereotypes, this can be an age in which a gender-expansive child stands out from the crowd. These children are normal and healthy, but it can be difficult for parents to navigate their child's expression and identity if it is different from their expectations or the expectations of those around them. \", \" As children develop their own identity during these early years, they're bound to experiment with attitudes and behaviors of both sexes. There's rarely reason to discourage such impulses, except when the child is resisting or rejecting strongly established cultural standards. If your son wanted to wear dresses every day or your daughter only wants to wear sport shorts like her big brother, allow the phase to pass unless it is inappropriate for a specific event. If the child persists, however, or seems unusually upset about their gender, discuss the issue with your pediatrician.  Your child also may imitate certain types of behavior that adults consider sexual, such as flirting. Children this age have no mature sexual intentions, though; they mimic these mannerisms. If the imitation of sexual behavior is explicit, though,\\xa0they may have been personally exposed to sexual acts. You should discuss this with your pediatrician, as it could be a sign of sexual abuse or the influence of inappropriate media or videogames. \", ' By age four, your child should have an active social life filled with friends, and they may even have a \"best friend.\" Ideally, they\\'ll have neighborhood and preschool friends they see routinely. But what if your child is not enrolled in preschool and doesn\\'t live near other children the same age? In these cases, you might arrange play sessions with other preschoolers. Parks, playgrounds, and preschool activity programs all provide excellent opportunities to meet other children.  Once your preschooler has found playmates they seems to enjoy, you need to take initiative to help build their relationships. Encourage them to invite these friends to your home. It\\'s important for your child to \"show off\" their home, family, and possessions to other children. This will establish a sense of self-pride. Incidentally, to generate this pride, their home needn\\'t be luxurious or filled with expensive toys; it needs only be warm and welcoming.  It\\'s also important to recognize that at this age your child\\'s friends are not just playmates. They also actively influence their thinking and behavior. They\\'ll desperately want to be just like them, even when they break rules and standards you\\'ve taught them rrm birth. They now realize there are other values and opinions besides yours, and they may test this new discovery by demanding things you\\'ve never allowed him—certain toys, foods, clothing, or permission to watch certain TV programs. ', \" Don't despair if your child's relationship with you changes dramatically in light of these new friendships. They may be rude to you for the first time in their life.Hard as it may be to accept, this sassiness actually is a positive sign that they're learning to challenge authority and test their independence. Once again, deal with it by expressing disapproval, and possibly discussing with them what they really mean or feel. If you react emotionally, you'll encourage continued bad behavior. If the subdued approach doesn't work and they persist in talking back to you, a time-out (or time-in) is the most effective form of punishment.  Bear in mind that even though your child is exploring the concepts of good and bad, they still have an extremely simplified sense of morality. When they obey rules rigidly, it's not necessarily because they understand them, but more likely because they wants to avoid punishment. In their mind, consequences count but not intentions. When theybreaks something of value, they'll probably assume they are bad, even if they didn't brea it on purpose. They need to be taught the difference between accidents and misbehaving. \", ' To help them learn this difference, you need to separate them from their behavior. When they do or say something that calls for punishment, make sure they understand they are being punished for the act not because they\\'re \"bad.\" Describe specifically what they did wrong, clearly separating person from behavior. If they are picking on a younger sibling, explain why it is wrong rather than saying \"You\\'re bad.\" When they do something wrong without meaning to, comfort them and say you understand it was unintentional. Try not to get upset, or they\\'ll think you\\'re angry at them rather than about what they did.  It\\'s also important to give your preschooler tasks that you know they can do and then praise them when they do them well. They are ready for simple responsibilities, such as setting the table or cleaning their room. On family outings, explain that you expect them to behave well, and congratulate them when they do. Along with responsibilities, give them ample opportunities to play with other children, and tell him how proud you are when they shares or is helpful to another child. ', \" Finally, it's important to recognize that the relationship with older siblings can be particularly challenging, especially if the sibling is three to four years older. Often your four-year-old is eager to do everything their older sibling is doing; just as often, your older child resents the intrusion. They may resent the intrusion on their space, their friends, their more daring and busy pace, and especially their room and things. You often become the mediator of these squabbles. It's important to seek middle ground. Allow your older child their own time, independence, and private activities and space; but also foster cooperative play appropriate. Family vacations are great opportunities to enhance the positives of their relationship and at the same time give each their own activity and special time.

Adults should never expect you to do this.”  “Certain body parts are private.”  “No adults (except parents, doctors, and nurses) should touch you where you normally wear a bathing suit.”  “If we get separated, find a security guard or police officer.”  “This is a very busy place. If you can’t find me, find a security guard or police officer, or ask someone to help you find one. That person will help you find me.”  When you take your child to a crowded place, look around and point out the person who is there to help if you do become separated.

It can be tempting for parents to try to solve these problems themselves or by talking with the other child’s parent. Instead, guide your child to solve problems. With your help, your child can learn how to solve social problems.  Help your child understand the other child’s point of view. “I guess Suzie wants a turn too.”  Teach your child the following:  Stay calm  Do not hit, grab, or shove  Use words:  “I get upset when you talk to me like that.”  “I’m sad you don’t want to play with me.”  “I’m angry you took the ball from me.”  Stand close by and watch as the children solve their problem.

', ' By: Jason Rafferty MD, MPH, EdM, FAAP  There are many ways parents can promote healthy gender development in children. It helps to understand gender identity and how it forms. ', ' Being a boy or a girl, for most children, is something that feels very natural. At birth, babies are assigned male or female based on physical characteristics. This refers to the \"sex\" or \"assigned gender\" of the child. Meanwhile, \"gender identity\" refers to an internal sense people have of who they are that comes from an interaction of biological traits, developmental influences, and environmental conditions. This may be male, female, somewhere in between, a combination of both or neither.  Self-recognition of gender identity develops over time, much the same way a child\\'s physical body does. Most children\\'s asserted gender identity aligns with their assigned gender (sex). However, for some children, the match between their assigned gender and gender identity is not so clear. ', ' Gender identity typically develops in stages:  Around age two: Children become conscious of the physical differences between boys and girls.  Around age two: Children become conscious of the physical differences between boys and girls.  Before their third birthday: Most children can easily label themselves as either a boy or a girl.  Before their third birthday: Most children can easily label themselves as either a boy or a girl.  By age four: Most children have a stable sense of their gender identity.  By age four: Most children have a stable sense of their gender identity.  During this same time of life, children learn gender role behavior—that is, do\\xading \"things that boys do\" or \"things that girls do.\" However, cross-gender preferences and play are a normal part of gender development and exploration regardless of their future gender identity. See The Power of Play - How Fun and Games Help Children Thrive.  The point is that all children tend to develop a clearer view of themselves and their gender over time. At any point, research suggests that children who assert a gender-diverse identity know their gender as clearly and consistently as their developmentally matched peers and benefit from the same level of support, love and social acceptance. ', \" All children need the opportunity to explore different gender roles and different styles of play. Parents can make sure their young child's environment reflects diversity in gender roles and encourages opportunities for everyone. Some ideas would be to offer:  Children's books or puzzles showing men and women in non-stereotypical and diverse gender roles (stay-at-home dads, working moms, male nurses and female police officers, for example).  Children's books or puzzles showing men and women in non-stereotypical and diverse gender roles (stay-at-home dads, working moms, male nurses and female police officers, for example).

It is also a good idea to check in with your child to learn about their preferences and to make sure they feel included without teasing or bullying.

While a child's gender-specific behavior (i.e. gender expression) at any time seems to be influenced by exposure to stereotypes and their identification with the people in their lives, the internal sense of being a girl, boy, in between or something else (i.e. gender identity) cannot be changed. \", ' Our expectations of \"what girls do\" and \"what boys do\" have changed. Many female athletes excel at their sports. Girls increasingly pursue subjects traditionally thought of as \"masculine.\" There are many famous male chefs, artists, and musicians―fields traditionally thought of as \"feminine.\" Over time, society has recognized that stereotypes of \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" activities and behaviors are inaccurate and limiting to a child\\'s development. Such interests also do not determine or influence one\\'s gender identity. Furthermore, our ability to predict who a child is based on early preferences is not very accurate and may be harmful if it leads to shame or attempts at suppressing their skills, talents and genuine self.  Still, when a child\\'s interests and abilities are different from what society expects, they may be subjected to discrimination and bullying. It is natural for parents to have gender-based expectations for their children and to want to protect them from criticism and exclusion. Instead of pushing children to conform to these pressures and to limit themselves, parents can play an important role in advocating for safe spaces where their children can feel comfortable and good about themselves.  If your child doesn\\'t excel in sports or even have an interest in them, for example, there will still be many other opportunities and areas in which they can thrive. Regardless of gender identity, each child has their own strengths that may not always conform to society\\'s or your own expectations, but they will still be a source of current and future success.

However, all children need support, love and care from family, school and society, which fosters growth into happy and healthy adults.

A large proportion of \\r teenage suicide attempts are linked to issues of gender and sexuality, particularly feelings of rejection. Many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals unfortunately attempt suicide during their lifetime.  As a parent, even when you struggle to understand and may not see eye-to-eye, your most important role is to offer understanding, respect and unconditional love for your child. This builds trust and puts you in a better position to help them through difficult times. \\r Research has shown that if a transgender teen has even just one supportive person their life, it greatly reduces their risk of suicide.  Transgender and gender-diverse children—like all children—need support, love and care from family, school and society. When supported and loved as they grow and develop, kids mature into happy and healthy adults. Pediatricians stand ready to assist in the healthy development of transgender and gender-diverse children. \", ' By Nancy Netherland  I have two teenagers. One identifies as \\'non-binary\\'; and sometimes as \\'I don\\'t know\\'; uses the pronouns she/they/them; has a girlfriend and identifies their sexual orientation as queer. The other identifies as she/her and pansexual.  When I had children, I didn\\'t know if they would be CIS-gendered, non-binary or trans, nor did I know what their sexual orientation would be. But my training as a therapist and the time I spent working in the early days of the AIDS pandemic had me well aware of elevated risk factors for children and young people who identify as LGBTQ+.  I knew that homophobia and transphobia could result in disturbing and dangerous outcomes. For example, I knew that nearly half of LGBTQ+ kids and young people seriously considered suicide in the past year, and that LGBTQ+ youth of color report higher rates of suicide attempts than their white peers.  But I also knew that LGBTQ+ youth who felt high social support from their family reported attempting suicide at less than half the rate of those who felt low or moderate social support.  So, knowing all this, I consciously tried to work resiliency and protective factors into how I parented from the time my kids were infants. Here are some guideposts that have served me well as a parent of non-gender conforming and queer children:  Ask, don\\'t assume. Since family acceptance is such a huge factor in protecting the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ+ kids, I decided not to assume anything about my children\\'s gender identity and sexual orientation. When my oldest child told me about their \\r first crush in middle-school, I made sure to ask if the person was a girl, boy, trans or non-binary. I saw the relief on my child\\'s face when I said \"girl\" and she said \"that one.\" I ask my kids their preferred pronouns, as well as their permission before sharing their pronouns outside of our immediate family.  Seek positive role models. Our community and inner circle include people who identify as gay/queer, trans and non-binary. I also commit to finding developmentally appropriate ways to integrate LGBTQ+ literature, role models, film, cultural events and celebrations into our lives. My children and I have joined Pride parades in support of my sibling who is non-binary and queer. Our family\\'s social media feeds include LGBTQ+ influencers, and we stream and watch shows together featuring queer and trans youth and their families.  Prioritize inclusion. I consciously use language and, when the kids were young, found stories that were inclusive: mommies who married mommies, kids born girls who realized they were really boys, and people who were both male and female. Our bookshelves include graphic novels and books detailing the contributions of LGBTQ+ people across the globe and history. If a form only has two genders on it – I change the form.  Enlist the support of trusted adults. I have made it a point to ensure my children\\'s medical providers and other trusted adults are inclusive and familiar with serving LGBTQ+ youth. My oldest child has a therapist who specializes in working with youth who are not CIS-gendered and identify as LGBTQ+. Our refrigerator has a list of youth help lines and mental health programs that my kids can call if needed. On that list are a bunch of LGBTQ+ organization and resources.  Ask for help. I make mistakes (still working on not misgendering) and I have a lot to learn. So, I call upon friends and family who grew up queer and non-gender conforming to support my children and my parenting. I have also reached out to our pediatricians for mental health and wellness resources. I look for and use online resources specifically for parents of LGBTQ+ kids.  I know that I cannot protect my children from the discrimination that is directed towards them and all people who are LGBTQ+, but I can make sure they feel accepted and seen in our home, and that they are connected with as many resources as possible to help them navigate health futures.Nancy Netherland is a mother and advocate for her two daughters, both former foster children born, and living, with chronic medical complexities.

', ' Some children are \"easy.\" They are predictable, calm, and approach most new experiences in a positive way. Other children are more difficult, not able to manage their emotional experiences and expression with ease. When a child\\'s personality doesn\\'t quite fit or match that of other family members, it can be a challenge for everyone. Of course no child is one way all the time, but each has his own usual type.  The ease with which a child adjusts to his environment is strongly influenced by his temperament - adaptability and emotional style. For the most part, temperament is an innate quality of the child, one with which he is born. It is somewhat modified (particularly in the early years of life) by his experiences and interactions with other people, with his environment and by his health.  By the time a child has reached the school years, his temperament is well defined and quite apparent to those who know him. It is not something that is likely to change much in the future. These innate characteristics have nothing to do with your own parenting skills. Nevertheless, the behavioral adjustment of a school-age child depends a lot upon the interaction between his temperament and yours, and how others respond to him - how comfortably he fits in with his environment and with the people around him. ', ' By being aware of some of the characteristics of temperament, you can better understand your child, appreciate his uniqueness, and deal with problems of poor \"fit\" that may lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.  There are at least nine major characteristics that make up temperament.  Activity level: the level of physical activity, motion, restlessness or fidgety behavior that a child demonstrates in daily activities (and which also may affect sleep). Rhythmicity or regularity: the presence or absence of a regular pattern for basic physical functions such as appetite, sleep and bowel habits.  Approach and withdrawal: the way a child initially responds to a new stimulus (rapid and bold or slow and hesitant), whether it be people, situations, places, foods, changes in routines or other transitions.  Adaptability: the degree of ease or difficulty with which a child adjusts to change or a new situation, and how well the youngster can modify his reaction.  Intensity: the energy level with which a child responds to a situation, whether positive or negative.  Mood: the mood, positive or negative, or degree of pleasantness or unfriendliness in a child\\'s words and behaviors.  Attention span: the ability to concentrate or stay with a task, with or without distraction.  Distractibility: the ease with which a child can be distracted from a task by environmental (usually visual or auditory) stimuli.  Sensory threshold: the amount of stimulation required for a child to respond. Some children respond to the slightest stimulation, and others require intense amounts. ', ' Every child has a different pattern of the nine temperament characteristics. Many, but not all, children tend to fall into one of three broad and somewhat loosely defined categories: easy, slow to warm up or shy, or difficult or challenging. These labels are a useful shorthand, but none offers a complete picture of a child. Many parents find it more useful to think about their child in terms of the nine temperament traits.  The easy child responds to the world around him in an easy manner. His mood is positive, and he is mildly to moderately intense. He adapts easily to new schools and people. When encountering a frustrating situation, he usually does so with relatively little anxiety. His parents probably describe him as a \"joy to be around.\" About 40 percent of children fall into this category.  Another temperamental profile may reveal a somewhat slow-to-warm-up or shy child who tends to have moods of mild intensity, usually, but not always negative. He adapts slowly to unfamiliar surroundings and people, is hesitant and shy when making new friends, and tends to withdraw when encountering new people and circumstances. Upon confronting a new situation, he is more likely to have problems with anxiety, physical symptoms or separation. Over time, however, he will become more accepting of new people and situations once he becomes more familiar with them.  The difficult or challenging child tends to react to the world negatively and intensely. As an infant he may have been categorized as a fussy baby. As a young child he may have been prone to temper tantrums or was hard to please. He may still occasionally be explosive, stubborn, and intense, and he may adapt poorly to new situations. Some children with difficult temperaments may have trouble adjusting at school, and their teachers may complain of problems in the classroom or on the playground. When children have difficult temperaments, they usually have more behavioral problems and cause more strain on the mother and family.  It is important to distinguish a difficult temperament from other problems. For instance, recurrent or chronic illnesses, or emotional and physical stresses, can cause behavioral difficulties that are really not a problem with temperament at all  Contact Us  About Us  Privacy Policy  Terms of Use  Editorial Policy  This site complies with the  HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here.  ', \" By: Jason RaffertyMD, MPH, EdM, FAAP  Parenting a gender-diverse child can leave some parents with a lot of questions and concerns for their child's wellbeing. Research suggests that \\r gender is something we are born with; it can't be changed by any interventions. So, rather than predicting or preventing who a child may become, it is better to value them for who they are now, even at a young age. This approach fosters secure attachment and resilience.  The American Academy of Pediatrics \\r recommends parents make their home a place where their child feels safe and loved unconditionally for who they are. Here are frequently asked questions from parents about topics related to gender identity. \", ' By preschool, kids start to recognize gender differences, both physically and socially. They also start to develop feelings, thoughts, and fantasy play that allows them to explore their gender. It is important to recognize that cross-gender preferences and play is a normal part of this exploration process, regardless of their future gender identity. However, research suggests that children who assert a gender-diverse identity know their gender as clearly and consistently as other kids do and benefit from the same level of support, love, and social acceptance.  It used to be the case that for children, gender-diverse assertions were seen as \"possibly true\" and not acknowledged until they were considered old enough to know for sure. This does not serve the child, because it increases discomfort without offering critical support and understanding. The best approach for parents is to love and appreciate their child as they are in the moment. ', ' While we do not understand why some children identify as gender-diverse or transgender, research suggests that gender identity involves biology, development, socialization and culture. There is no evidence that parenting is responsible for a child having a \\r gender identity that is not in line with his or her gender assigned at birth. Childhood \\r trauma does not cause a child to become gender-diverse, transgender, or impact their sexual orientation. Variations in gender identity and expression are normal aspects of human diversity.  If a mental health issue exists, it most often stems from other factors, such as bullying, discrimination, and other negative experiences. Being seen as \"different\" is not easy, especially in childhood, and may contribute to teasing or bullying. If this is happening, speak with the child\\'s teacher and the school to \\r create a plan to prevent bullying. The most important thing to remember is to support, love, and accept your child as he or she is. ', ' During puberty, hormone \"blockers\" can be used to delay physical development. This is reversable and gives an individual more time to explore their gender identity. Available data show that delaying puberty in transgender children generally leads to improved psychological functioning in adolescence and young adulthood. For those who were assigned female at birth, periods may be particularly distressing. Periods can be reduced or blocked with \"blockers\" or with certain contraceptive agents. ', ' As gender-diverse individuals express their underlying gender identity, they engage in a gender affirmation process (sometimes referred to as \"gender transition\"). This process involves reflection, acceptance, and, for some, intervention. There is no prescribed path, sequence or endpoint, but the process may include any of the following components:  Social affirmation: This is a reversible intervention in which children and adolescents express their asserted gender identity by adapting hairstyle, clothing, pronouns, name, etc.  Social affirmation: This is a reversible intervention in which children and adolescents express their asserted gender identity by adapting hairstyle, clothing, pronouns, name, etc.  Legal affirmation: When elements of a social affirmation, such as name and gender marker, become official on legal documents (birth certificates, passports, school documents, etc.). The steps to doing this vary from state to state, and often specific documentation from the child\\'s health providers is required.

Some changes are partially reversible if hormones are stopped, but others are not.

These changes are not reversible.  The decision of whether and when to initiate gender-affirmative treatments is personal and involves careful consideration of the risks, benefits and other factors unique to each patient and family. The gender affirmation process is best when facilitated through collaboration between the patient, their family, their primary care provider, a mental health provider (preferably with expertise in caring for transgender and gender diverse youth), social supports, and a pediatric endocrinologist or adolescent medicine gender specialist, if available.Ask your pediatrician if a \\r telehealth visit by phone or video call is an option.

This may also be part of a person's personal journey or exploration of gender. \", ' Being transgender is not contagious. Some children and teens may not have confronted or feel they have to suppress gender-diverse traits until they find nonjudgmental and affirming peers or online communities.

', ' Although childhood shyness is commonplace, it concerns many parents, especially those who place great value on sociability. Some children become shy because of harsh life experiences, but most are born that way. For some middle-years children, social situations and interactions can be terrifying. When they come in contact with new children, they rarely feel at ease. Typically, they are unwilling or unable to make the first move, preferring to abandon a potential friendship rather than reach out to the unfamiliar. A few of these timid children may be emotionally distressed, but they are in the minority. In fact, some children are just naturally withdrawn and slow to warm up in new situations. ', \" In some cases, shyness can be disabling. Extremely shy children often do not adapt as well as most of their peers in the classroom and on the playground. The longer this pattern exists, the more difficult it is for children to change. Shyness can increasingly lead to purposeful avoidance of social settings and withdrawal, and ultimately create an inability to function effectively as a social adult. If your child's shyness becomes debilitating, it may be caused by an anxiety disorder or a temperament pattern; then an evaluation by a child mental-health professional would be helpful. \", ' Most shy children, however, do well in relationships and in social settings once they are past an initial period of adjustment. Children who have difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships even after the ice-breaking period merit more concern and attention. Eventually, many (and perhaps most) children who are shy learn to conquer their tendency. They function in ways that are not obviously timid or reticent, although inside they may still feel shy. Parents can gently guide or direct their children into social situations in which they can learn to successfully interact. ', ' Most children want to be liked, yet some are slow in learning how to make friends. Others may long for companionship but might be excluded from one group or another, perhaps picked on because of the way they dress, poor personal hygiene, obesity, or even a speech impediment.

They often tend to be aggressive or disruptive and very sensitive to teasing. They may be bullies and rule-violators, or they may be so unsure of themselves that they invite the rejection of others.

This latter group might be respected and admired by others but simply feel more comfortable in solitary pursuits or in spending time with parents, siblings other adults, or even pets.

Don\\'t take your child\\'s behavior personally. Temperament is innate, and your child probably is not purposely trying to be difficult or irritating. Don\\'t blame him or yourself.  Try to prioritize the issues and problems surrounding your child. Some are more important and deserve greater attention.

Review your expectations of your child, your preferences and your values. Are they realistic and appropriate? When your youngster does something right, praise him and reinforce the specific behaviors that you like.  Consider your own temperament and behavior, and how they might also be difficult. Think how you might need to adjust yourself a bit to encourage a better fit with your child.  Anticipate impending high-risk situations, and try to avoid or minimize them.

This is a part of growing up and testing adult guidelines and expectations. It is one way for children to learn about and discover their own selves, express their individuality, and achieve a sense of autonomy. As they stretch their independent wings and engage in minor conflicts with their parents, they discover the boundaries of their parents' rules and of their own self-control.  Sometimes, however, these conflicts are more than occasional disturbances and become a pattern for how parents and children interact. Disobedience can have a variety of causes. At times, it is due to unreasonable parental expectations. Or it might be related to the child's temperament, or to school problems, family stress, or conflicts between his parents. \", \" When you have a chronically disobedient child, examine the possible sources of his inner turmoil and rebelliousness. If this has been a persistent pattern that has continued into middle childhood, closely evaluate your own family situation:  How much respect do your family members show for one another?  Do they respect one another's privacy, ideas, and personal values?  How does the family work out its conflicts?  Are disagreements resolved through rational discussion, or do people regularly argue or resort to violence?  What is your usual style of relating to your child, and what forms does discipline usually take?  How much spanking and yelling is there?  Do you and your child have very different personalities and ways of getting along in the world that cause friction between you?  Is your child having trouble succeeding at school or developing friendships?  Is the family undergoing some especially stressful times?  If your child has only recently started to demonstrate disrespect and disobedience, tell him that you have noticed a difference in his behavior and that you sense he is unhappy or struggling. With his help, try to determine the specific cause of his frustration or upset. This is the first step toward helping him change his behavior. \", \" If you react to your child's talking back by exploding or losing your temper, he will respond with disobedience and disrespect. By contrast, he will become more obedient when you remain calm, cooperative, and consistent. He will learn to be respectful if you are respectful toward him and others in the family. If he becomes disobedient and out of control, impose a timeout until he calms down and regains self-control.  When your child is obedient and respectful, compliment him for that behavior. Reward the behavior you are seeking, including cooperation and resolution of disagreements. These positive efforts will always be much more successful than punishment. \", \" For some disobedient children, you may need to obtain professional mental health treatment. Here are some situations where outside counseling may be necessary:  If there is a persistent, long-standing pattern of disrespect of authority both at school and at home.  If the patterns of disobedience continue in spite of your best efforts to encourage your child to communicate his negative feelings  If a child's disobedience and/or disrespect is accompanied by aggressiveness and destructiveness  If a child shows signs of generalized unhappiness -- perhaps talking of feeling blue, unliked, friendless, or even suicidal  If your family has developed a pattern of responding to disagreements with physical or emotional abuse  If you or your spouse or child use alcohol or other drugs to feel better or cope with stress  If relationships within your family show signs of difficulty and lack of cooperation, then family therapy may be indicated. By dealing with and resolving these problems at a young age, you can minimize and even prevent more serious struggles that may emerge as your children reach adolescence. The key is early identification and treatment.

These situations can often be dealt with successfully by working one-on-one with your child, or through a three-way interaction involving you, your child, and her teacher.  On occasion, a concern persists despite your best efforts to resolve it. Per\\xadhaps you are unhappy with certain aspects of the learning environment in your child\\'s classroom. Maybe you feel she is not receiving the proper help with a particular subject. Or perhaps your child has complained that the teacher has humiliated her in front of her classmates.  In situations like these, approach the teacher first with your concern. Ex\\xadplain the problem without being accusatory or insulting. (Avoid statements like \"You\\'re not doing your job!\" or \"I cannot believe you said that to my child!\") Give the teacher a chance to explain what is taking place, to share an\\xadother perspective, and to suggest a solution. If you are dissatisfied with that encounter or if you feel that sufficient progress is not being made after trying the teacher\\'s plan, then bring your problem to the attention of the principal. The principal may suggest a meeting with you and the teacher. In many in\\xadstances the difficulty can be resolved with input from the principal.  The principal can become your ally in other situations too. Approach him or her for problems unrelated to the classroom—for example, difficulties with a bus driver or a playground aide. At times, other school personnel—such as guidance counselors or psychologists—may be helpful.  If\\xa0the principal and teacher, or others, have initiated a specific plan to improve the situation, give things a reasonable chance to improve. (It will not change in a couple of days.) However, if the problem still remains unre\\xadsolved, then continue up the educational hierarchy, which may lead you to the superintendent\\'s office. For an issue involving school district policy, the superintendent and his or her associates will be the decision makers. If you still remain dissatisfied, approach the school board members. They may be able to get action on your problem, or put you in touch with the person who can.  As you move up the administrative ladder, gather, organize, and stay fo\\xadcused on the facts; save your emotional reactions for someone else who can acknowledge them. Be persistent and remain as pleasant and objective as pos\\xadsible. You will not make progress by losing your temper and by alienating the people who might help solve the difficulty.  At some point along this path of seeking help, consult your child\\'s pediatrician for advice or for a referral to another professional outside the school system.

', ' Many difficulties can arise at school that will require your intervention. One of the most common is when a child feels rejected by classmates.  If your youngster comes home upset and crying that \"everyone is being mean to me at recess and in the cafeteria,\" keep in mind that at some time most children have conflicts with their friends and end up feeling pushed away. Parental reassurance can comfort these youngsters until things return to normal at school.  However, if a pattern of rejection exists, let your child know that you are sen\\xadsitive to how difficult this situation is for him, and that you are going to help him figure out ways to make things better. Give him a clear message that you are on his side and are going to help.  Rejection by a child\\'s peers may be a group reaction to someone they see as different. It may also result from inappropriate behavior on the part of both parties and need to be modified.  Ask your child for more facts about the situation. Schedule an appointment with his teacher. Consider requesting that the principal or guidance counselor attend the meeting. Have them obtain information from the recess and lunch aides about what is happening.

The Myth of 10,000 Steps  How Recent Demographic Forces Created the Solo Generation  Coronavirus Disease 2019  Narcissism  Dementia  Bias  Affective Forecasting  Neuroscience ', ' Verified by Psychology Today ', ' Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff  Anxiety is on the rise among children and adolescents. Studies show that as many as one in eight children may experience significant anxiety. Knowledgeable observers offer a number of reasons. Perhaps most important, children’s lives have changed so that there is almost nonstop sedentary screen time at the expense of play and physical activity, experiences through which children traditionally decompress, work out their concerns, and form supportive relationships. And what’s on those screens are, often enough, new opportunities for young people’s worry.  In addition, in almost every domain of life, there is far more uncertainty, and uncertainty breeds anxiety. In response to an array of economic and cultural shifts, parents today commonly put significantly more pressure on their children to achieve than did parents of a generation or two ago, and many children, carrying the burden of outsize expectations, worry about meeting them. Further, overprotected more than previous generations, children grow up not merely without opportunities to develop problem-solving skills but without the belief that they can adequately cope with the threats life throws their way. Helicopter parenting fosters the development of anxiety in children. ', ' When do children develop the capacity to worry?  What do children worry about?  What does anxiety look like in a child?  What types of anxiety are common in children?  What makes children vulnerable to anxiety?  Do children get anxious if a parent is anxious?  Are there some parenting practices that make children vulnerable to anxiety?  How can I know if my child is anxious in school?  Do children ever outgrow anxiety?  What are the best treatments for a child with anxiety?  How does anxiety affect child development?  Are there some things to say or not to say to an anxious child?  What is the best way to help a child manage anxiety? ', ' Anxiety requires a certain amount of cognitive development. Newborn infants have some built-in fears, but it takes a while for the capacity for anxiety—worrying about the possibility of a future bad outcome—to come online. Imagination is required, and that capacity is expressed most clearly in the development of pretend play, emerging around age 2.  Much everyday observation and many studies show that at approximately 8 months of age, infants develop a fear of being separated from their mother or other caregiver and become clingy. In fact, the reaction of toddlers to brief separations from parent or caregiver is commonly used as a test of the strength of attachment. Separation anxiety between ages 18 months and 3 years is a normal developmental stage. Separation anxiety becomes problematic if it persists into the school years and causes children to fear leaving home or getting lost. ', ' Children worry, and they feel alone with their worries. Early on, they worry about shadows, ghosts, and monsters or imaginary creatures under the bed or in the closet. They worry about fires and disasters and other events they can’t control. As they move into the larger world in childhood, they worry about their family, especially their parents. They worry that arguments between their parents might mean divorce and the end of their family. They worry about a parent dying or leaving, about having to choose between parents, and about where they will have to live. Children may overhear parts of conversations between parents or others, draw unwarranted but troubling conclusions, and spend a great deal of time silently ruminating about events they lack full comprehension of.  Children worry about school, about getting called on in class, getting bad grades, and getting bad teachers. They worry about being late. They worry about school shooters, and their worry is often reinforced by the frequent “shooter drills” that schools are required to have. Children worry about being accepted and liked by their peers, being bullied or humiliated, being excluded from online conversations and real-life parties, and losing friends. They also worry about making mistakes and not pleasing their parents or not meeting their parents’ expectations for them.  Studies show that, even among adolescents, exposure to negative conflict between parents creates anxiety in children by threatening children’s sense of security. The anxiety creates hypervigilance, and as a result of exposure to conflict, their attention is biased toward disproportionately noticing negative conflict, reinforcing their cause for worry. And, yes, children of all ages are immersed in the world around them and worry about the larger world, too. They may worry about their family’s financial woes—or their own prospects for getting a job. They worry about terrorists and the effects of climate change. Normal worries become problematic when they interfere with sleep, going to school or paying attention in school, or engaging in activities with others. ', ' Anxiety is an increasingly common problem among children today. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 7 percent of children age 3 to 17 have a diagnosed anxiety disorder; the average age of onset is 11 years. Yet many believe that anxiety is vastly underdiagnosed and underrecognized in children. Children often display anxiety by asking repetitive “what if” questions—“What if there’s a fire?” ’What if you get sick?” Logical explanations and attempts at reassurance don’t suffice. Children may reveal anxiety in expressing concern about an event very far off in the future. They may be overly or unnecessarily apologetic, suggesting worry whether others have reason to be upset with them.  And then there are all the physical manifestations of anxiety—general jitteriness, palpitations, headaches, stomachaches, and not feeling well enough to go to school. Anxiety can create problems falling asleep or staying asleep, or it can disrupt sleep with nightmares. It can also show up as problems remembering things or concentrating on things. School refusal is a common problem among children with anxiety. It may take the form of not wanting to get out of bed on school mornings. Poor school performance can be a sign a child is preoccupied with worry. Because avoidance is a common, if maladaptive, approach to anxiety-provoking situations, anxious children may be unwilling to participate in experiences others eagerly embrace—going to friends’ houses, or family outings or vacations. Refusing to be separated from parents is a common sign of anxiety in children. ', ' Children can develop specific phobias or they can develop more broad-based anxiety disorders. More rarely, they can manifest obsessive-compulsive disorder. In extreme cases, they may develop selective mutism. Most common, however, are separation anxiety, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety is normal—in toddlers. They experience anxiety when a parent leaves the room or drops them off at daycare. But they can be distracted and the distress they manifest subsides. Separation anxiety is a disorder in school-age children who can’ bear to be separated from a parent or refuse to leave home to go to school. It is most common among children 7 to 9 years old.  Social anxiety disorder sometimes called social phobia, is more common among older children; they display anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in routine social situations. They have a fear of being observed—and judged. It can keep children from wanting to go to school or engaging in any activity that puts them in the spotlight, such as speaking up in class or even reading a passage if called on to do so. Social anxiety disorder reflects a specific worry—negative judgment by others—and it is manifest only in social settings.  In contrast to social anxiety disorder, which reflects a specific worry—negative judgment by others—and occurs only in social settings, generalized anxiety disorder can encompass any extended periods of worry in any of the major domains of life—health, family, home, school friendships, natural disasters, the environment. It is accompanied by physical symptoms such as jitteriness and difficultly sleeping as well as difficulty concentrating. Both types of anxiety are amenable to treatment with psychotherapy. ', ' Children can be vulnerable to anxiety if they are born with the touchy temperament of behavioral inhibition; they do not willingly explore their environment and may find new experiences threatening because the amygdala is highly reactive or circuitry connecting the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex fails to recognize repeated stimuli. Studies show that approximately 20 percent of Caucasian children are born with such a reactive temperament, inclining them to shyness, timidity, and anxiety. Yet, despite such a temperamental tilt toward anxiety, it’s how parents react to their children’s temperament that influences whether anxiety develops; their actions can prevent anxiety or allow it to persist. In classic long-term studies of such children, psychologist Jerome Kagan found that if they are allowed to find their own adaptive niche, they grow up to function well.  Children can acquire anxiety through early traumatic experiences. Or they may be consistently exposed to childrearing practices that transmit parental worries, that limit the acquisition of problem-solving skills, or that generate self-doubt. Failing to equip children to enter adulthood is a special problem among Millennials and Gen-Zers.  Too, children may become anxious through overexposure to information about worrisome things—economic crises, global warming, political upheaval. Further, while some degree of anxiety is normal, and children may need help learning to put anxiety in its place, they naturally differ in the degree to which they are aware of and sensitive to the physical components of anxiety. Some children may just feel anxiety more.  There is also widespread consensus that the emergence of social media is linked to high levels of anxiety in young people, particularly in adolescence. Despite enabling connectedness, the technology breeds social anxiety by providing new means of social quantification, nonstop opportunities for social comparison, and new pathways for social exclusion and bullying. And because social media never stops, it can generate a fear of missing out and doubts about self-adequacy that manifest in anxiety. Here’s an important irony to consider about social media: Many studies show it actually increases children’s sense of isolation. Isolation, in turn, magnifies the perception of threat, which is where anxiety starts. ', ' Children can get anxious if a parent is anxious, but that doesn’t in any way indicate how the anxiety is transmitted. Often, anxiety is transmitted to children unwittingly through an array of parental practices—talking to children about adult concerns, depriving children of opportunities to learn coping skills, and through accommodating children’s anxiety. Anxiety, with its payload of physical and cognitive distress, is a natural mental state, and, as with all emotional experiences, children benefit from learning constructive ways of handling the distress.  Too often, however, contemporary parents protect their children from the distress of anxiety and accommodate the children in avoiding anxiety-provoking conditions. The upshot, studies show, is that children become more anxious and intolerant of uncertainty, never learning how to become comfortable with the discomfort, how to persist in spite of it, or how to tackle the problem that is the source of the anxiety. ', ' In general, parents who have trouble with the law, consistent problems in relationships, or recurring difficulty managing their own life, or any of the demands of adulthood, are apt to generate anxiety in their children. Similarly, parents who fail to keep their promises to their kids or whose behavior toward them is erratic and unpredictable are signaling stronger than words can express that they are unreliable as guardians. Anxiety is a whole-body response to threat; it dissipates only when people feel safe—when children apprehend that the adults are capable of taking care of the children and can handle life’s challenges through their own resources.  More specifically, parents who do not give their children permission to experiment and fail, or who take over difficult task from them, rather than provide coaching and encouragement from the sidelines, are setting kids up for anxiety. So too are parents who do not let their children get comfortable with some degree of distress. Only by learning that distress is tolerable (to say nothing of expectable) can children find their own way through it and come out with the confidence that they can keep themselves safe in many circumstances. ', ' School performance is often a good barometer of children’s mental health. Anxiety can rob children of the ability to pay attention in school, and class engagement and participation may suffer as well as grades. So may the power to concentrate on homework or other tasks, or even to remember to do them. Teachers are usually good observers of children’s patterns and are quick to spot changes in concentration, participation, and performance.  Periodic conversations with teachers can elicit revealing information about children’s behavior that may otherwise be invisible to parents. In addition, parents who put everything else aside for a few minutes every day to have regular conversations with their children about whatever is on their mind and going on in their life are in a privileged position to hear directly when concerns arise. That might be the only way they learn about such experiences as bullying, which often escape notice by teachers and administrators but are a strong disincentive for going to school. ', ' Unfortunately, children are far more likely to grow into their fears than out of them if anxiety is not addressed. Anxiety is considered a marker—a gateway to other mental health problems. The sooner it is addressed, the less likely it is to lead to serious mental health conditions. Without treatment anxiety is apt to persist, interfere with children’s social function and development, and wreak havoc on family life. It leads not just to future anxiety but to depression, substance use, and risk for suicide. As for treatment, it’s most helpful if children learn the cognitive skills to challenge worry and to tame their own fearful imagination. ', ' The data are clear: Many studies show that the best way to treat the growing problem of childhood anxiety —better than a placebo, better than pharmaceutical approaches—is with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). It gives children the tools to disarm anxiety for a lifetime. Working with a therapist, usually in a course of 12 sessions, children acquire the ability to face their worries. They learn what triggers their anxieties and they learn that the perceptions of threat that send distress signals throughout their body are nevertheless false.  They learn how to rationally challenge those perceptions, and to substitute negative thinking patterns with positive ones. CBT teaches the anxious to question their beliefs and learn that feared situations are safe. Another widely validated treatment is exposure therapy, particularly for phobias and social anxiety. In a safe setting children are gradually introduced to the element that triggers their fears, until they are no long reactive to it. It is highly affective.  Attention bias modification therapy (ABMT) is an emerging treatment. It is based on research showing that both children and adults with anxiety are overly attuned to negative events in their environment, such as upset or angry faces. They preferentially notice and give weight to them, ignoring neutral or even positive stimuli. Such a cognitive bias toward threat ushers in pathological anxiety. In brief, screen-based sessions, children are shown a series of photographs of actors making specific facial expressions. ABMT retrains attention away from threat, averting the hyperstimulation of the amygdala that sets off neural alarms. ', ' Anxiety adds a stress on development at a time when children and families are experiencing many stresses—and children have fewer outlet for play and other activities that relieve pressure. If parents or others accommodate children’s worries and allow young people to avoid those situations that give rise to worry, children miss out on experiences are essential for full development socially and emotionally. In addition, the children have no way to discover how to disarm their concerns, and they do not learn how to live with uncertainty. Giving in to fear doesn’t help a child learn to solve the problem that gives rise to anxiety. ', ' Mental health problems are isolating, and children benefit by knowing that they are not alone in their experience of worry and that every single person on earth experiences anxiety at some time. Children find courage in hearing stories from admired adults who have faced worries similar to theirs and found ways to cope with such worries.  Experts encourage parents to help children face their worries, rather than accommodate them—to not alleviate a child’s anxiety by yielding to the distress. Allowing children to withdraw from activities that generate the discomfort of anxiety reinforces the sense of threat, deprives children of experiences that are important for development, and keeps children from developing the sense of self-efficacy that comes from mastering life’s little and big challenges. Giving in to the fear doesn’t work. Studies show that it is counterproductive—it increases children’s anxiety. Children do best when they are shown how to disarm their own worries or encouraged to discover their own ways to do so.  Don’t dismiss or belittle children’s concerns. If they’re worrying about something, it is something to worry about. Don’t try to talk children out of their concerns—without showing them how to do it. Similarly, don’t tell them to calm down; show them how (learning to deep-breathe is one of the most effective tools imaginable; it directly stimulates the parasympathetic nerve to quiet the physical symptoms oof anxiety. Have children blow bubbles or blow out the “candles” of your fingertips. ', ' According to surveys by the American Psychological Association, parents are alarmingly unaware of children’s anxiety. Children may feel ashamed about their distress; it’s not something to announce over the dinner table. Or parents are too busy to give full attention to those moments when their children might be looking for a way to confide; it’s hard to feel heard when the other person is holding a cell phone. Sometimes parents are dismissive of children’s feelings, and assuring a worrying child “there’s nothing to worry about” is dismissive, not reassuring or helpful. But there are things a parent can do to manage a child’s anxiety:  • Listen to concerns; don’t dismiss children’s feelings. Just feeling heard is comforting.  • Encourage emotional literacy. Teach children about anxiety in an age-appropriate way. Teach them that it shows up in physical signs—arousal and jitteriness—and a mental track of worry Let them know its normal but sometimes gets the upper hand. Many find that the concept of false alarms is a helpful one.  • Limit children’s exposure to news of disasters and catastrophic events. Eventually children will develop the cognitive capacity to handle such information, but constant replay magnifies the sense of threat.  • Allow time for relationships. Anxiety results when children do not feel safe. Relationships of all kinds—with parents, with other family members, with peers, with teachers—are natural antidotes to anxiety.  • Encourage play and physical activity. The physical tension that anxiety creates can often be dissipated by play and exercise. Making sure that children have regular opportunities for such activities gives them important tools for regulating their own emotions and managing their own mental health.  • Offer specific skills for dissipating the discomfort anxiety creates. Teach kids deep breathing, which subdues the nerves of alarm.  • Help your children face the discomfort of anxiety to know that it won’t destroy them, rather than allowing them to avoid situations that give rise to worry. .  • Keep your own anxieties to yourself. Do not share them with your children. ', ' Tchiki Davis, Ph.D. on April 12, 2023 in Click Here for Happiness  Discover what you can do to cope with stress and stop stressing yourself out.

People with autism have difficulties with social and communication skills. They have restricted interests and engage in repetitive behaviors. They also tend to experience sensitivity or discomfort from sensory stimulation such as certain lights or sounds.  Because autism\\'s symptoms vary greatly, the condition is said to exist on a spectrum, referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorder. Asperger\\'s syndrome refers to \"high functioning\" autism, but it’s no longer a formal diagnostic term.  Autism usually manifests by age two. The condition is diagnosed four times more frequently in males than in females, according to the CDC, although women are often overlooked and misdiagnosed. The frequency of diagnosis has surged over the past 20 years; it is not clear whether the incidence is truly increasing, whether experts are more aware of it, or whether the diagnosis has shifted to include lesser degrees of impairment.  There is no cure for autism, nor is one universally sought: Many people argue that autism should not be framed as a medical condition in need of amelioration. For those on the lower-functioning end of the spectrum, targeted practices and therapies can help alleviate symptoms. ', \" While the severity of symptoms varies greatly, there are invariably impairments to social and communication skills. Some children with autism do not talk at all and remain mute throughout life, while others have mild social challenges. Children with autism also show restricted interests and repetitive behaviors.  Parents may notice that their infant avoids eye contact or doesn't respond, and it may be difficult for them to form emotional bonds and parental attachment. Children with autism may have unusual responses to sensory stimulation and may be highly sensitive to certain sounds, textures, tastes, or smells. They may have deficits in motor coordination and poor muscle tone.  Autistic children exhibit many kinds of repetitive behaviors early in life, such as hand flapping, body rocking, and making sounds. They may arrange or stack objects over and over again. Some children inflict injury to themselves by repeated actions such as hand biting and head banging. They also have an early preference for unvarying routines of everyday life.  For more, see Autism Symptoms and Diagnosis. \", ' No one fully understands what causes autism. The number of children diagnosed with the disorder has increased significantly since the turn of the millennium, but experts are not sure whether that reflects an improvement in diagnostic awareness or a true increase in prevalence.  Research shows that genetics is a factor, because people who have a sibling with autism are more likely to have autism themselves. Autism is also more likely in individuals who have an older parent. Very low birth weight is also a risk factor, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, and ASD occurs more frequently in people with some genetic conditions, such as Fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis.  For more, see What Causes Autism? ', \" There are many effective approaches for managing or treating autism. Early intervention with highly structured behavioral, cognitive, and communication therapies can sometimes dramatically help children with autism learn skills. School-based educational programs designed for children with autism can be effective in improving intellectual functioning.  Programs that make use of applied behavior analysis (ABA) have become widely accepted as the standard of treatment. In most programs, parents are encouraged to be highly involved in their children's care.  While no medication can correct the impairments common to autism, psychoactive drugs including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are sometimes prescribed to help control specific symptoms. Anticonvulsant medication may reduce the number of seizures a person has but not eliminate them entirely.  For more, see How Is Autism Treated? \", ' Autism seems to overlap with an array of medical and mental health conditions. People with autism can also have ADHD, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, sleep challenges, gastrointestinal problems, or Fragile X syndrome.  It’s difficult to disentangle why these conditions coexist and how one causes the other (or vice versa). Yet identifying them is important because it allows people with autism to address distressing symptoms and improve their day to day life.  For more, see Autism and Related Conditions. ', ' Learning that a child has autism can be overwhelming, and parents might cycle through different emotions. Parenting a child with autism often means researching programs and services, keeping detailed records, and becoming a child’s advocate in school and medical settings, in addition to adjusting to new financial and relationship considerations.  It’s important to remember that autism is a relatively common condition, and there are many resources and professionals available to help parents provide the best support possible for their child.

However, there is a growing effort among companies to recognize the benefits of neurodiversity, hire people with autism, and support them in their roles.  For more, see Autism and the Workforce. ', ' The concept of neurodiversity embraces, celebrates, and respects differences between and among people with autism and other atypical variations in thinking and behavior. Those who support the neurodiversity movement assert there is no one “normal” brain against which all other brains can be measured. Therefore, autism should be broadly accepted and recognized as a natural variation on the human neurological condition.  Advocates point out the valuable skills and contributions of different types of minds, just as they highlight the value of other types of diversity. At the same time, some researchers and medical experts believe the concept of neurodiversity can be reasonably applied only to those with high-functioning autism.  For more, see Neurodiversity and the Benefits of Autism. ', ' Scientists have developed numerous theories to help explain what gives rise to autism. One of these ideas is the diametric mind theory, which proposes that autism and psychosis exist on opposite ends of a spectrum of mentalism, the ability to interpret the minds and motives of others. Another is the extreme male brain theory, which represents autism as an extreme version of a typically “male” brain in terms of its systematizing abilities. Other ideas have emerged as well, such as the social motivation hypothesis and the intense world hypothesis. Overall, more research will be needed to understand this complex phenomenon.

While no medication can eliminate the impairments common to autism, psychoactive drugs including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are often prescribed to help control specific symptoms.  There are also many alternative treatments promoted to parents of children with autism, such as facilitated communication and auditory integration training, to name a few; many have been shown to be ineffective. It is important for parents of children with autism to look into prospective treatments as thoroughly as possible. \", ' Is there a cure for autism?  How is autism treated?  What is applied behavior analysis?  How much ABA therapy is recommended?  Does everyone in the autism community support ABA?  Why are early interventions so important?  Which medications treat autism?  Should I medicate my autistic child?  Can autism be treated in adulthood? ', ' Autism cannot be cured with a treatment, intervention, or medication. But various therapies can help many children improve social and communication skills, reduce repetitive behaviors, and function well in daily life.  Assessing the success of treatment is complicated by the diverse experiences of those on the spectrum. Some may have mild social discomfort, embrace routine and stability, or leverage their passion into a career. Others may have an intellectual disability or struggle with violent outbursts. Most fall somewhere in between. The success of treatment can vary with the condition. ', ' Autism is often treated with behavioral therapies. The most widely used is called Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), which helps children develop concrete skills to communicate, form relationships, and navigate daily life.  ABA and other behavioral therapies have been shown to improve development and skills, especially when introduced at an early age. Popular variations on ABA include the Early Start Denver Model and Pivotal Response Training. Many children also take social skills training. Behavioral therapies are often accompanied by speech therapy, occupational therapy, or sensory integration therapy. ', ' Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the most common treatment for children with autism. ABA teaches children to develop skills for communication, relationships, movement, academics, hygiene, and self-care. For example, children may learn to make eye contact, write their name, or use the bathroom.  ABA centers around understanding the components of a specific behavior—the trigger, the behavior, and the consequence—and rewarding and reinforcing the desired behavior at each step. ', ' The program is highly structured and can require 20 or 40 hours of one-on-one therapy per week. ABA begins from a young age and can be tailored to address a child’s individual needs. Today there are variations of ABA with more flexibility, such as the Early Start Denver Model and Pivotal Response Training. ', ' Beliefs about ABA can be controversial in the autism community. Adults with autism may believe the therapy’s emphasis on suppressing behaviors to “fit in” prevents them from understanding their true selves and being accepted as neurodiverse. Therapists and parents may have witnessed substantial improvements and believe in ABA’s power to improve a child’s life. The severity of someone’s condition is one of the components that informs their perspective. ', ' Early interventions can make a big difference for children with autism. Research suggests that the best outcomes of behavior therapy occur more frequently in kids who begin around age three. Addressing challenges at an earlier developmental stage can help children acquire the skills they need to more easily navigate school, relationships, and daily life.  An early diagnosis and treatment plan also provides parents with support earlier, which can alleviate their stress and strengthen their relationship with their child. ', ' There are no medications that treat the underlying symptoms of autism. However, many medications target related problems and can improve daily life for those on the spectrum.  For example, antipsychotics might be prescribed to treat tantrums, aggression, and self-injury. Stimulants might be prescribed to treat difficulties with attention and hyperactivity. An anticonvulsant may be critical for treating seizures. ', ' It’s common for parents to struggle with when to consider medication for their children. The choice should be carefully considered, and there may be situations in which the side effects are too harmful. Overall, there are many instances in which the benefits of treating an accompanying problem can outweigh the side effects in the long run. ', ' Receiving an autism diagnosis in adulthood is validating and empowering for some individuals. Therapies including applied behavior analysis, cognitive behavioral therapy, and social skills training can still be helpful for adolescents and adults seeking treatment. However, it’s worth noting that treatment studies are primarily conducted on children.

The scientific understanding of this overlap is often elusive.  Addressing co-occurring problems won't eliminate the core features of autism. Yet treating specific symptoms that people are struggling with can tremendously improve daily life for those on the spectrum. \", ' Autism and ADHD  Autism and Anxiety  Autism and Depression  Autism and Epilepsy  Autism and Sleep Problems  Autism and Gastrointestinal Problems  Autism and Highly Sensitive People  Autism and Fragile X syndrome ', ' Studies estimate that 30 to 80 percent of children with autism meet the criteria for ADHD, and 20 to 50 percent of children with ADHD meet the criteria for autism. Clinicians can now provide a dual diagnosis for children with both conditions, per the DSM-5.  Autism and ADHD can look very similar, as both involve struggles with communication, social cues, attention, and impulsivity. Scientists are currently investigating the biological and genetic roots that the conditions may share.  People with both conditions may be more impaired than people with either condition alone. Individuals with autism or parents of children with autism may want to seek a diagnosis if they believe they have ADHD, as that could influence treatment options, such as the decision to prescribe stimulant drugs. ', ' Nearly 40 percent of children with autism also have an anxiety disorder—which might include social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or a specific phobia. The overlap of autism and anxiety may be due to the features of autism, such as sensory overload, communication barriers, social challenges, cognitive rigidity, and task frustration. Distinguishing whether symptoms of autism contribute to anxiety or result from anxiety can be challenging.  Parents of children struggling with anxiety can aim to identify what specifically triggers anxiety in their child, and then plan for or modify those triggers. They may explore treatment options such as medication or cognitive-behavioral therapy. ', ' People with autism are four times more likely to suffer from depression than neurotypical individuals. This trend may be due to genetics as well as the loneliness, bullying, or rumination that some with autism face.  Depression is difficult to spot because people with autism can struggle to express their feelings. There are similar barriers to treatment, such as the ability to explore emotions in therapy and tolerate side effects of medications. Still, cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressants help some, while social support and employment programs are valuable for all. ', \" Just over 1 percent of the general population suffers from seizures, but 20 to 40 percent of people with autism do. Scientists don't fully understand the link between the two, but they may have shared genetic roots and related imbalances in neural communication.  Seizures can lead to severe injury, so parents may want to evaluate their child's risk of seizures with a doctor. If the child is diagnosed with a seizure disorder, they may be prescribed an anticonvulsant. Seizure disorders can develop in adolescence or adulthood, so it's an aspect of autism that should continue to be monitored. \", ' Sleep problems are twice as common for children with autism than for neurotypical children. People with autism can have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep throughout the night. Even worse, a poor night of sleep may exacerbate symptoms of autism, like social impairments and repetitive behaviors.  Sleep problems may be due symptoms of autism such as sensory sensitivity or the conditions that often co-occur with autism, such as ADHD, anxiety, and digestive problems. The genetic underpinnings of autism may also play a role.  Speak with your child’s doctor or your own doctor about whether a sleep evaluation or medication may be merited. Good sleep hygiene, especially keeping a consistent bedtime routine, can help people with autism get a good night’s rest ', ' Around 70 percent of children with autism have gastrointestinal problems, compared to just 28 percent of neurotypical children, research suggests. These problems include stomach pain, constipation, and diarrhea. Children with autism are also more selective about the foods they eat.  The connection between autism and the gut is still emerging, but one possibility is that the interaction between a child’s genes and certain foods leads to an imbalance of gut bacteria. The risk of autism (and other disorders) is slightly elevated in children delivered by c-section, which suggests another pathway by which gut microbiota is influenced. Additionally, many autistic people suffer from stress and anxiety, which can fuel digestive problems.  Parents or individuals with autism should consult their doctor about which diets or programs they can explore. Anecdotally, some parents have reported that cutting out wheat, gluten or dairy has been helpful. ', \" People might confuse autism and high sensitivity because both involve extreme sensitivity to one's environment. A stimulus that seems small to others, such as a shirt's texture or an intrusive noise, can feel overwhelming to people with autism or high sensitivity. They may elicit panic or tantrums if they can't be controlled.  However, the two experiences are very different. Recent research identified three key distinctions. One is that autism is accompanied by social challenges, such as the inability to make eye contact or respond to another's emotion, while highly sensitive people are extremely responsive to those cues. Social interactions are especially meaningful to those with high sensitivity, but they aren't as inherently rewarding to those with autism. Brain areas that involve calmness, sociability, and emotion are less active in people with autism. \", ' Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that can lead to developmental delays, intellectual disability, learning disability, and social and communication impairments. The condition is typically caused by a mutation in the gene FMR1, which prevents the production of a protein critical for healthy brain development and communication.  At least one-third of people with Fragile X syndrome also have autism. The substantial overlap between the two underscores the genetic causes of autism. Other genetic disorders linked to autism include Rett syndrome, Down syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis.

Notwithstanding your deep love for your child, parents can experience feelings of grief, anger, fear, and stress. Parents may worry that their vision for the child’s future has disappeared, that their relationship with their spouse will be strained, that the family will face mounting financial pressures. It’s natural to feel overwhelmed.  But know that autism is a common condition—around 1 of every 54 children has a diagnosis—and interventions have helped many children with autism go on to live full, meaningful lives. There are advocacy organizations, support groups, mental health professionals, and loved ones who are ready to support you and your child to the fullest. ', ' What do I do if my child is diagnosed with autism?  How do I handle the stress of raising a child with autism?  How can I help teach my child social skills?  How should I talk to my child about autism?  How should I discipline my autistic child?  How can parents avoid blaming themselves?  How does having a child with autism affect a marriage?  How does having a child with autism affect their siblings?  How much does it cost to raise a child with autism?  Does insurance cover autism services? ', ' A child’s early years represent an important developmental window, so it’s valuable to research insurance coverage and explore behavioral therapies with your child’s doctor as soon as possible. These may include applied behavioral analysis, speech therapy, and occupational therapy.  Joining a local support group can be comforting and empowering, as it allows you to connect with parents going through the same experiences you are. The group can share emotions, fears, discoveries, and resources, especially those that pertain to services in their state or community.  It’s helpful to keep organized records of your child’s medical appointments to create a complete picture of your child at different stages. You may also want to take notes on developmental milestones, improvements, and health conditions.  Connect with your child in any way you can, such as by talking, reading, or showing educational videos, even if it seems like your child isn’t paying attention. Read accounts that other parents and autistic adults have written.  Finally, take care of yourself. Set aside time to recharge. Seek out positive people and avoid those who drain your energy. ', ' Many features of autism—tantrums, aggression, language deficits, limited family opportunities, and the inability to gain independence—contribute to the deep and distinct distress that many caregivers experience.  Parents can struggle with grief, sadness, anger, and hopelessness. They may fear for their safety and the safety of their children. Constantly navigating health care systems and insurance companies requires immense time, energy, and money, leading to exhaustion and financial pressures.  To navigate these challenges, parents should research and access any and all services available to them. They can lean heavily on family and friends for support. If caregivers begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, they should seek professional help. Finding a support group near you is invaluable, as its members can provide understanding, emotional strength, and crucial information. ', ' Every parent wants their children to form relationships that make them happy. Children with autism approach social situations with anxiety and frustration, but parents can help kids gain confidence, especially those on the high-functioning end of the spectrum.  Parents can model and explain social behavior to their child. After a particular interaction, they can provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation for their behavior, including their facial expression, tone of voice, and body language. Explanations and instructions that target the “why” of the behavior can be helpful since that understanding doesn’t come naturally to those with autism.  Parents can discuss social situations the child sees on TV or ones they’re likely to encounter at school. The parent and child should take turns role-playing, so that the child practices playing both individuals in the scenario.  Scheduling play dates with kids in a support group can allow children to practice social skills while providing parents an opportunity to discuss strategies with other parents. ', ' Parents should aim to be open, factual, and positive. Children pick up on others’ feelings and attitudes, which can shape how they see themselves. If parents tiptoe around autism, keep it hidden, or feel uncomfortable talking about it, children can come to believe that they should hide their autism or feel ashamed or fearful of it.  Parents can also recognize their child’s strengths and challenges. Everyone has domains in which they struggle and those in which they excel. A child with autism may struggle to connect with others but excel at sewing or math. This can be a valuable framework with which to discuss their experience. ', ' Tantrums and other difficult behaviors often emerge from an autistic child’s need to communicate. An essential component of discipline is therefore identifying what sparked their meltdown or what they want to express. Maybe the child was overwhelmed by the crowd at a holiday dinner or forbidden from playing with a toy. The first step of disciplining a child is observing and identifying potential triggers.  Parents may then seek to implement a system of rewards for positive behavior and punishment for negative behavior. Following this plan consistently can help the child understand the consequences of their actions. ', ' There is a long history of “blaming” parents for their child’s autism, most prominently when psychologist Bruno Bettelheim falsely attributed autism to a cold, detached parenting style, infamously coining the term “refrigerator mothers.” Today we know that parenting style does not lead to autism—the condition is rooted in genetics and emerges from many different factors. Parents are not at all responsible for the development of the condition.  Yet some parents, often driven by societal misperceptions, may still struggle with feelings of blame. Parents can acknowledge their emotions and fears, and then recognize that their child also has strengths that they can support and appreciate. Those on the higher end of the spectrum may also reject the premise that there is anything to be blamed for, believing that autism is not a disorder but a different way of thinking and being. ', ' Some research has identified a higher divorce rate for parents of children with autism, relative to the overall rate of divorce. A more recent study found no difference: 64 percent of children with autism had married parents, and 65 percent of children without autism had married parents. The idea that couples divorce due to autism may be overblown, or at the least, it merits more research.  Additionally, in a study of divorced parents of children with autism, 78 percent of respondents said that they divorced after their child was diagnosed, but 76 percent reported that autism wasn’t the primary reason they divorced. About half considered the diagnosis to be a contributing factor.  Strong marriages may weather the storm and emerge stronger on the other side. Marriages that are already struggling may be unable to endure the additional stress, and couples may ultimately decide to divorce. Becoming aware of how the stress of a child with autism has influenced other couples may help parents of a newly diagnosed child to anticipate and overcome those challenges. ', ' A child with autism can change a family’s dynamic. Siblings of children with disabilities often grapple with stress and anxiety, in addition to emotions ranging from fear and guilt to embarrassment and resentment. They may try to hide those emotions from their parents so as not to be an additional burden.  Siblings can also experience parentification, as they may be expected to assume greater responsibilities and independence. They may feel neglected by their parents, who need to devote a tremendous amount of time to therapy and medical appointments and emotional energy into parenting. Additionally, siblings may lack the knowledge and information that parents have, which could result in fear for their sibling.  Nevertheless, siblings of children with autism can also come to embody countless positive traits, such as empathy, cooperation, tolerance, altruism, maturity, and responsibility. ', ' Raising a child with autism costs around $60,000 each year, according to the advocacy group Autism Speaks. Costs may be higher if the child’s autism is more severe.  Finances are devoted to obtaining therapies, education, caregiver time, and health care. Parents may also face financial strain because a partner may decide to leave work to care for the child full time. ', ' Services for children with autism are very often—but not universally—covered by insurance. All 50 states now require private health insurance policies to provide some degree of coverage for autism treatment. Most Medicaid plans cover Applied Behavioral Analysis when deemed medically necessary. Yet insurance companies may not reimburse the full cost or the length of time a child really needs.  Children with autism are eligible for educational services through their public school system. They may develop an individualized education plan or a 504 plan, both of which aim to help kids fully participate in their education.  Joining a local support group can be extremely helpful for parents of children with autism. In addition to emotional support, members have expertise in navigating available services in their state.

Rather than a single gene or lifestyle trend, autism is the result of complex interactions between many different factors.  Genetics contribute more to the condition than do environmental factors. Autism is highly heritable, and people who have a sibling with autism are more likely to have autism themselves. People are more likely to have autism if they have related genetic disorders, such as fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis.  Autism is also more likely due to a number of environmental factors, such as maternal infection, diabetes, high blood pressure, and older paternal age at conception. Pinning down the connection to other elements of the environment, such as air pollution, has proven more difficult.  The number of children diagnosed with the disorder has risen dramatically since the 1960s. Experts believe that much of the change can be attributed to changes in diagnostic criteria and greater awareness among clinicians and the general public. ', ' Is autism genetic?  What are genetic risk factors for autism?  Do environmental factors cause autism?  Do vaccines cause autism?  What prenatal factors increase the risk of autism?  What is causing rates of autism to increase?  Are boys more likely than girls to have autism?  Why are boys more likely to have autism? ', ' Yes, genes play an important role in autism. The heritability of autism is estimated to be around 80 percent. This means that if one identical twin has autism, the other twin would have an 80 percent chance of developing autism. In the case of fraternal twins, who share half rather than all of their DNA, the second twin has a 40 percent chance of developing autism. People whose siblings have the condition are also more likely to develop it. People with genetic disorders such as fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, or tuberculosis sclerosis are also more likely to have autism, according to the CDC. ', ' Dozens of genes are now known to correlate strongly with autism, and hundreds more have smaller connections. Genetic differences can be inherited through a parent’s DNA or they could spontaneously occur in the sperm, egg, or embryo. A person who is said to have risk factors often has a first degree relative with an autism spectrum disorder, but it is impossible to quantify the risk at this time.  It is important to understand that having genetic risk factors for autism does not mean that a person will necessarily go on to develop the condition. ', ' Several environmental factors increase the risk of autism, and they center around experiences in the pregnancy or infancy that may influence brain development. Premature birth and low birth weight raise the risk of autism, as do diabetes, high blood pressure, and infection during pregnancy. Having an older father is also a risk factor, likely because the chance of spontaneous genetic mutations increases with age.  There is some evidence of a correlation between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy or early childhood and the onset of autism. However, researchers are still working to understand this relationship. Pinning down the connection between autism and any single environmental factor is difficult because it’s nearly impossible to isolate—there are so many variables at play. ', ' No. There is no connection between vaccines and autism. Vaccines are powerful tools that doctors and parents rely on to protect children from dangerous illnesses.  The specious claim emerged from a paper published in the journal The Lancet in 2013 by disgraced physician Andrew Wakefield, who claimed that a preservative in vaccines called Thimerosal caused autism. The paper was deeply flawed and later retracted by the journal that published it. Rigorous research has continued to find no connection between the two. ', ' Taking the medications thalidomide or valproic acid during pregnancy can raise the risk of autism, according to the CDC. There is some research that antidepressant use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism, but that research is not yet definitive.  Other elements linked to a higher likelihood of developing autism include having an infection, autoimmune disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure during pregnancy. This may be due to the manner in which inflammation and the immune response influence the developing fetus. There also seem to be correlations between autism risk and pregnancies that are less than a year apart.  Some evidence indicates taking prenatal vitamins containing folic acid, vitamin B-9, and vitamin D may offer some protection and reduce the likelihood of autism. ', ' The prevalence of autism has continued to rise over the past few decades. Today, 1 in 54 children are estimated to have autism, according to the CDC. Research suggests that this surge is not due to changes in the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the condition. The rising prevalence is instead likely due to changes in the diagnostic criteria and greater awareness of autism and its symptoms.  Clinicians diagnose mental health conditions based on criteria delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The pre-2013 version, the DSM-IV, contained three categories: autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. The current iteration, the DSM-5, replaces those categories with one overarching diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder. The current definition of autism is no longer reserved for the most extreme cases; it embraces subtler ones as well. ', ' Autism occurs 4 times more often in boys than in girls. This asymmetry may be due to a combination of biological and diagnostic forces.  From a biological perspective, women with autism have more family members with the condition than men and have more genetic mutations. These findings and others form the basis for the “female protective effect,” a theory that women possess some form of biological protection against autism. ', ' The “extreme male brain,” was proposed by British scientist Simon-Baron Cohen. People with autism have an extreme form of the male brain, the theory goes, as men tend to be drawn to systems and efficiency while women excel at empathy and reading emotions. Others have pushed back that underlying biological differences between the sexes could not be large enough to account for the condition and the idea hasn’t been replicated by other scholars.  From a diagnostic perspective, clinicians may be more aware of the condition in boys and therefore identify it more readily. Additionally, the instruments to screen and diagnose the conditions were created and validated on males.  Although autism occurs more frequently in boys, many girls and women have the condition. The symptoms may present differently, and they may learn to camouflage the condition. Women may be overlooked or misdiagnosed as a result, but finally receiving a diagnosis has the potential to be life-changing.

The term \"spectrum\" reflects the fact that symptoms vary across different individuals, ranging in type and severity.  The condition appears and is able to be diagnosed by about age two. Some children do not reach developmental milestones, while others appear to develop typically until the onset of the disorder. While the severity of symptoms varies greatly, there are invariably impairments to social and communication skills. Parents may notice that their infant avoids eye contact or doesn\\'t respond, and it may be difficult for them to form emotional bonds and parental attachment. Some children will experience awkwardness trying to maintain eye contact or sustain a conversation, while those on the severe end of the spectrum could have aggressive outbursts or remain nonverbal.  Children with autism exhibit many kinds of repetitive behaviors early in life, such as hand flapping, body rocking, and making sounds. They may arrange or stack objects over and over again. Some children inflict injury to themselves by repeated actions such as hand biting and head banging. They show an early preference for unvarying routines of everyday life.  Restricted interests are another feature of autism, so children may develop a fascination with train schedules or comic books, for example. They may devote tremendous time to those interests and become experts on the topic. Kids with autism may also be distressed by sensory experiences such as a buzzing lightbulb or an uncomfortable shirt. ', ' How is autism diagnosed?  At what age is autism typically diagnosed?  What are the early signs of autism?  What are signs of autism in adults?  What are signs of autism in women?  Is autism a disability?  What’s the difference between autism and Asperger’s syndrome? ', ' The symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, according to the DSM-5, involve challenges with social skills, communication, sensory processing, and restrictive or repetitive behaviors. Like many mental health conditions, autism can’t yet be diagnosed from a biological marker such as a blood test or brain scan, so clinicians rely on children’s behavior for screening and diagnostic assessments.  The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) is a common screening tool for children with autism that relies on a parent or caregiver’s response to 23 questions. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) allows a clinician to diagnose the condition by observing the child for about an hour, and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) tests for the condition based on a 93-question survey for parents or caregivers. ', ' Most children can be reliably diagnosed with autism at age 2. Some kids may be diagnosed earlier if they have more severe symptoms, but most children in the U.S are diagnosed at age 4 or later.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children are screened for autism during check-ups with their doctor at 18 months and 24 months old. Doctors may encourage additional screening if babies are at higher risk of developing the condition, such as if they have a sibling with autism.  Early diagnosis is key because it can allow parents and children to access therapies and services that will support healthy development, such as behavioral therapy. People are increasingly being evaluated as adults as well, and a late diagnosis of autism can be life-changing for those who have navigated the experiences of autism without a formal label. ', ' Early signs of autism include avoiding eye contact, not showing interest in other children or parents, talking less than other children, and feeling distressed by small changes to the daily routine, according to the CDC.  It can also be valuable to monitor whether a child is reaching developmental milestones. But it’s important to keep in mind that autism presents differently in different children. Some may not reach those milestones, while about a quarter may pass each milestone but regress later. ', ' Signs of autism in adulthood may include difficulties maintaining eye contact, keeping up conversation, making friends, interpreting sarcasm or idioms, and reading others’ emotions.  People with autism may have repetitive behaviors, such as certain hand movements, and prize routine and structure. They may be passionate about a particular topic, such as math, and discuss or practice it extensively. They may also be distressed by particular sounds, sights, or textures.  It can be difficult to diagnose adults with autism, as cases may be milder, but it still is a transformative and empowering experience for those who do receive an official diagnosis. ', ' Autism occurs 4 times more often in boys than in girls. But many women still struggle with the condition—and they’re often overlooked or misdiagnosed.

The term \"spectrum\" reflects the fact that symptoms vary across different individuals, ranging in type and severity.  The condition appears and is able to be diagnosed by about age two. Some children do not reach developmental milestones, while others appear to develop typically until the onset of the disorder. While the severity of symptoms varies greatly, there are invariably impairments to social and communication skills. Parents may notice that their infant avoids eye contact or doesn\\'t respond, and it may be difficult for them to form emotional bonds and parental attachment. Some children will experience awkwardness trying to maintain eye contact or sustain a conversation, while those on the severe end of the spectrum could have aggressive outbursts or remain nonverbal.  Children with autism exhibit many kinds of repetitive behaviors early in life, such as hand flapping, body rocking, and making sounds. They may arrange or stack objects over and over again. Some children inflict injury to themselves by repeated actions such as hand biting and head banging. They show an early preference for unvarying routines of everyday life.  Restricted interests are another feature of autism, so children may develop a fascination with train schedules or comic books, for example. They may devote tremendous time to those interests and become experts on the topic. Kids with autism may also be distressed by sensory experiences such as a buzzing lightbulb or an uncomfortable shirt. ', ' How is autism diagnosed?  At what age is autism typically diagnosed?  What are the early signs of autism?  What are signs of autism in adults?  What are signs of autism in women?  Is autism a disability?  What’s the difference between autism and Asperger’s syndrome? ', ' The symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, according to the DSM-5, involve challenges with social skills, communication, sensory processing, and restrictive or repetitive behaviors. Like many mental health conditions, autism can’t yet be diagnosed from a biological marker such as a blood test or brain scan, so clinicians rely on children’s behavior for screening and diagnostic assessments.  The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) is a common screening tool for children with autism that relies on a parent or caregiver’s response to 23 questions. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) allows a clinician to diagnose the condition by observing the child for about an hour, and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) tests for the condition based on a 93-question survey for parents or caregivers. ', ' Most children can be reliably diagnosed with autism at age 2. Some kids may be diagnosed earlier if they have more severe symptoms, but most children in the U.S are diagnosed at age 4 or later.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children are screened for autism during check-ups with their doctor at 18 months and 24 months old. Doctors may encourage additional screening if babies are at higher risk of developing the condition, such as if they have a sibling with autism.  Early diagnosis is key because it can allow parents and children to access therapies and services that will support healthy development, such as behavioral therapy. People are increasingly being evaluated as adults as well, and a late diagnosis of autism can be life-changing for those who have navigated the experiences of autism without a formal label. ', ' Early signs of autism include avoiding eye contact, not showing interest in other children or parents, talking less than other children, and feeling distressed by small changes to the daily routine, according to the CDC.  It can also be valuable to monitor whether a child is reaching developmental milestones. But it’s important to keep in mind that autism presents differently in different children. Some may not reach those milestones, while about a quarter may pass each milestone but regress later. ', ' Signs of autism in adulthood may include difficulties maintaining eye contact, keeping up conversation, making friends, interpreting sarcasm or idioms, and reading others’ emotions.  People with autism may have repetitive behaviors, such as certain hand movements, and prize routine and structure. They may be passionate about a particular topic, such as math, and discuss or practice it extensively. They may also be distressed by particular sounds, sights, or textures.  It can be difficult to diagnose adults with autism, as cases may be milder, but it still is a transformative and empowering experience for those who do receive an official diagnosis. ', ' Autism occurs 4 times more often in boys than in girls. But many women still struggle with the condition—and they’re often overlooked or misdiagnosed.

Although it was once classified as its own condition, Asperger’s is no longer an official diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The behavior ascribed to Asperger’s is now encompassed under the umbrella diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder.  People with high-functioning autism/Asperger's often have difficulty with social situations, and they may not be able to understand the perspectives and feelings of others. However, their language and cognitive skills are often typical.  People with the condition may also engage in specific, repetitive body movements. They often have an orientation toward detail and an interest in systemizing, which can come across as an obsession. Some may show remarkable facility in a narrowly focused and usually non-social area, such as baseball statistics or train schedules.  For more on causes, symptoms, and treatments of Asperger's syndrome, see our Diagnosis Dictionary. \", ' Signs and Symptoms  Causes  Services and Treatment  Neurodiversity and the Benefits of Asperger’s ', ' As with all autism spectrum disorders, people with Asperger\\'s have difficulties in social situations. For example, they may not make eye contact, understand a joke, or recognize how to continue a conversation. People with Asperger\\'s may struggle to understand nonverbal signals or decipher body language.  Because people with Asperger\\'s can lack the ability to understand the perspective of others, they often do not return social feelings or share in the happiness or distress of others. They might fail to develop friendships as children and may be singled out by other kids as \"weird\" or \"awkward.\"  People with Asperger\\'s often function best with routines and rituals. They are often intensely preoccupied with a narrow area of interest, and occasionally demonstrate incredible abilities in that domain (sometimes referred to as a savant). Like those with full-blown autism, they may engage in repetitive behaviors like finger-twisting, hand-waving, or rocking.  Asperger’s was a distinct diagnosis in the previous version of the DSM. In the DSM-5, which was published in 2013, Asperger’s is part of the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The symptoms include:  Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts. Examples include the inability to engage in conversation back and forth, a lack of eye contact, or the inability to maintain relationships over time.  Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Examples include repeating the same hand movement consistently, strictly adhering to routines, or a fixation on a specific interest, such as the subway system.  For a diagnosis, symptoms would also be present during the person\\'s childhood and lead to significant distress in the person’s daily life.  The DSM-5 classifies the severity of autism into three levels. Level 1 is classified as “Requiring support.” Level 2 is classified as “Requiring substantial support.” Level 3 is classified as “Requiring very substantial support.” As Asperger’s was historically a mild form of autism, it can map onto Level 1. ', \" The roots of Asperger's syndrome or autism are not well understood. Current research points to a complex combination of biological and environmental elements.  There is a genetic component to Asperger's and autism, because the condition tends to run in families. For example, identical twins are much more likely than fraternal twins or siblings to both have autism. Recent research indicates that there may be a common group of genes whose variations or deletions make an individual vulnerable to developing autism with varying severity and symptoms.  Brain abnormalities may also be involved, as scientists have revealed structural and functional differences in specific regions of the brains of children and children with Asperger's. These differences are most likely caused by the abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development that goes on to alter the brain circuits that control thought and behavior.  Certain environmental factors also elevate the risk of developing autism, such as older parental age, maternal infection during pregnancy, maternal diabetes, exposure to the drug valproate in utero, and low birth weight. \", ' Over the past 50 years, the number of people with autism has continued to rise. Today, 1 in 54 children is on the spectrum, according to the CDC. Research suggests that genetic and environmental contributions to autism have remained consistent over time; therefore, the surge may be due to increased awareness and diagnostic shifts.  The DSM-IV, which was used before 2013, contained three categories: autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. The DSM-5 replaced those categories with one overarching diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder. Such changes in the criteria likely resulted in additional people receiving an autism diagnosis. Additionally, both families and clinicians today are likely more aware of autism and its symptoms than in past decades, making diagnosis more likely. ', ' Autism is about four times more common in boys than in girls, according to the CDC. But the reason for this trend still isn’t completely clear. One hypothesis, proposed by scientist Simon Baron-Cohen, is the extreme male brain theory, which states that men’s general propensity for systematizing and women’s generally propensity for empathizing render autism an extreme form of the male brain.  But the theory has been critiqued, as others believe that that biological difference cannot account for such a large discrepancy, and that genetics, social learning, and diagnostic bias play a role as well. ', \" Treatments for Asperger's are primarily aimed at teaching social and communication skills. Social skills training focuses on the tools necessary to interact successfully with other children. Speech therapy may help children improve conversational ability and understand the normal pattern of give and take.  Cognitive behavior therapy is often used to help children manage their emotions and to curb obsessive interests and repetitive routines. Sensory integration therapies may help some children, while occupation and physical therapy may help those with poor motor coordination. Parents often need training and support in behavioral techniques to use at home. \", ' Behavioral interventions that address specific behaviors and identify triggers for them are often helpful. Interventions that teach both children and their families effective communication strategies are also effective.  Planning for adolescence and the transition to adulthood is also important. Finding medical and behavioral health services, job skills development, community opportunities, and residential supports can make an important difference for people with autism and their families. ', ' One of the most well-studied behavioral therapies for autism is Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). The basic premise of ABA is to break down skills into component parts and, through repetition and reinforcement, encourage learning. The approach relies on observing a situation and defining what would benefit a child, even when he or she may still be focused elsewhere. For example, if a child is not interested in greeting others, through ABA the clinician might choose to teach those skills anyway because they have long-term value. ABA is the typical starting point for children with more severe symptoms, but it can play a role for children with milder symptoms as well. ', ' Many people in the autism community embrace their differences and dispute the need for treatment. They hope that society can become more understanding and accepting, and provide support as needed. Those with milder symptoms, who previously might have been diagnosed with Asperger’s, are often more likely to share this perspective than parents of those with severe difficulties, such as those who are nonverbal or self-injurious. This difference in how the condition is experienced and perceived has led to a vigorous debate over the question of a cure for autism. ', ' The concept of neurodiversity embraces, celebrates, and respects differences between and among people with Asperger\\'s syndrome and other functional but atypical variations in thinking and behavior. While many people with Asperger\\'s wish to improve their social skills in order to cope in a more effective way with the neurotypical majority, others see value in their unusual way of looking at the world.  Those who are part of, or support, the neurodiversity movement promote the idea that there is no one \"normal\" type of mind but rather variations in the way individual minds work. They appreciate the valuable skills and contributions of different types of minds, just as they appreciate the value of other types of diversity. ', ' Neurodiversity embraces cognitive differences. Those differences, a range of thoughts and perspectives, have propelled humanity’s progress throughout history, such as in science and the arts. When everyone sees a problem the same way, they may all be stumped; the person who views it differently may be the one to discover a solution. Additionally, the routines and systems that people with autism often enjoy can be valuable in the workforce, whether through folding laundry or spotting errors in a software’s code. ', ' Savant syndrome is the name for a rare but extraordinary condition in which someone with a mental impairment, often a form of autism, also displays a spectacular capacity or skillset. For example, a child who has autism and is nonverbal may be able to rapidly complete a jigsaw puzzle placed in front of him picture side down; just by looking at the shapes of, say, 200 pieces, the child can quickly put the puzzle together. It’s estimated that around 10 percent of people with autism are savants, so it’s still the exception, rather than the rule, in the autism community. ', ' The term twice-exceptional, often abbreviated as 2e, refers to intellectually gifted children who have some form of disability. These children are considered exceptional because of their intellectual gifts and because of their special needs. These so-called disabilities often include diagnoses on the autism spectrum and ADHD. Parents are increasingly seeking help for their children in this realm, as are many adults themselves.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, one- and two-year-olds can also be expected to display most of the following social and cognitive skills, although each child develops differently and may achieve some milestones earlier or later than others and still be considered to be experiencing healthy development:  Social Development  Hand things to others as a form of play.  Have temper tantrums.  Display a fear of strangers.  Show affection to familiar people.  Engage in pretend play, like feeding a doll.  Cling to caregivers in new situations.  Point to show things to others.  Explore alone, but with parents or caregivers within sight.  Copy others.  Show excitement to be around other children.  Express defiance, such as when told not to do something.  Play mostly beside other children, but begin to include others in games like chase.  Cognitive Development and Communication Skills  Point to get attention and show someone what they want.  Say several single words, including “no,” and, eventually, form sentences of two-to-four words.  Understand the purpose of common objects like phones, brushes, and spoons.  Show the ability to point to specific body parts.  Scribble on their own.  Follow 1-step verbal requests without any gestures (“sit down”) and, eventually, two-step commands.  Point to things or pictures when they are named, including in books, and begin to name them themselves.  Recognize the names of familiar people.  Repeat words overheard in conversation.  Find things even when hidden under two or three covers.  Begin to sort shapes and colors.  Complete familiar sentences and rhymes.  Play simple make-believe games.  Build towers of 4 or more blocks.  Start to favor a dominant hand. ', ' If a child in late toddlerhood is not walking steadily, copying others, following simple instructions, or gaining new words, is limited to fewer than 6 words, is not displaying the ability to point to familiar objects and people, does not notice when a caregiver leaves or returns, or loses skills they once had, a parent or caregiver should schedule a developmental screening with their pediatrician. ', ' Empathy involves understanding what another person may be feeling, and then feeling or imagining a similar emotion. Research suggests that children clearly display empathy by about 18 months of age, often taking action to help an adult who seems to be struggling with a task or comforting a parent or caregiver who seems sad or distressed. For children who may be highly sensitive, taking on others’ emotions may be easy, even if it’s sometimes overwhelming; for other children, research shows, parents who talk about emotions, openly and often, can help them develop higher levels of empathy—along with, of course, modeling empathy at home. ', ' Yes, even if it’s harder when they are tired or overwhelmed. Research shows that, before turning 2, children will share their food with others, even a stranger—and even if they are hungry themselves. Evolutionary psychologists believe that “altruistic food transfer” is a key behavior that separates humans from other primates, one that fosters group cohesion and, in a larger sense, the success of the community and the species. ', ' Toddlerhood has long also been known as “the terrible twos,” because children often struggle to manage their emotions and behavior at this age. But it is also the stage when kids begin to play with each other, and recent research has shown that, contrary to their reputation, toddlers respect and favor fair play. Watching pretend scenes in which one puppet won a conflict because another puppet got out of its way or otherwise deferred to it, toddlers reported that they liked the winning puppet better. But when the winning puppet ended a conflict by pushing the other puppet out of the way, toddlers did not like the winner more. ', ' They can certainly try, and if they show an interest, parents should let them (within reason). A large body of research shows that virtually all toddlers who watch a parent or caregiver do chores will make gestures to help or copy them. This desire to help out, researchers believe, is nearly universal, but many parents mistakenly do not allow it, often because they believe the toddler may get hurt, may create more work for the adult, or just slow things down. And when parents do ask toddlers to help, they often recruit them with the promise of a reward, quashing their instinct to chip in just to be helpful. ', ' Fear is not innate in humans, many researchers believe (the fear of creatures like spiders and snakes may be an exception), but is instead learned, typically in late infancy and early toddlerhood. For most children, their first fear is of strangers, strange places, or the departure of parents or caregivers. Some fears are conditioned—being “attacked” by an aggressive or overly enthusiastic or affectionate dog, for example. Others fears are learned by example, such as seeing a parent’s fearful reaction to blood. ', ' Research has long suggested that significant differences in eventual academic success emerge between children who hear more words in their homes at a young age, and those who don’t. More recent studies find that the differences can be vast: Some adults use as few as 400 words in a 90-minute period with a child, while others use as many as 9,000. But another key difference emerged from these studies: the importance of the diversity of the words a child hears. Children whose parents or caregivers used a wider range of words, including difficult words and even nonsense words, appeared to have an academic advantage later, even if they hadn’t heard the highest volume of words. ', ' Dyslexia, which involves difficulty with accurate word recognition, as well as poor decoding and spelling, affects 10-15 percent of children. Effective intervention and instruction can help children with dyslexia manage and excel in school, but early detection is greatly beneficial and many signs tend to emerge in toddlerhood. Parents should be aware of struggles with phonological awareness skills—in other words, if a child fails to match letter names to their corresponding sounds, or has trouble blending sounds into larger words, recognizing rhymes, or pronouncing common words.

They can also be expected to throw tantrums when those bids are denied. ', ' What are the key milestones of toddler development?  What are signs of developmental concern during toddlerhood?  How can parents promote empathy in toddlers?  Can toddlers share?  How do toddlers manage conflict?  Can toddlers help around the house?  Why do toddlers get scared?  How many words do children need to hear?  Can a parent detect dyslexia in a toddler? ', ' Most children take their first steps during this period, before tackling stairs and starting to run. They begin to undress themselves, to eat with utensils and drink from cups, to throw a ball (or whatever else is handy), and draw straight lines and circles.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, one- and two-year-olds can also be expected to display most of the following social and cognitive skills, although each child develops differently and may achieve some milestones earlier or later than others and still be considered to be experiencing healthy development:  Social Development  Hand things to others as a form of play.  Have temper tantrums.  Display a fear of strangers.  Show affection to familiar people.  Engage in pretend play, like feeding a doll.  Cling to caregivers in new situations.  Point to show things to others.  Explore alone, but with parents or caregivers within sight.  Copy others.  Show excitement to be around other children.  Express defiance, such as when told not to do something.  Play mostly beside other children, but begin to include others in games like chase.  Cognitive Development and Communication Skills  Point to get attention and show someone what they want.  Say several single words, including “no,” and, eventually, form sentences of two-to-four words.  Understand the purpose of common objects like phones, brushes, and spoons.  Show the ability to point to specific body parts.  Scribble on their own.  Follow 1-step verbal requests without any gestures (“sit down”) and, eventually, two-step commands.  Point to things or pictures when they are named, including in books, and begin to name them themselves.  Recognize the names of familiar people.  Repeat words overheard in conversation.  Find things even when hidden under two or three covers.  Begin to sort shapes and colors.  Complete familiar sentences and rhymes.  Play simple make-believe games.  Build towers of 4 or more blocks.  Start to favor a dominant hand. ', ' If a child in late toddlerhood is not walking steadily, copying others, following simple instructions, or gaining new words, is limited to fewer than 6 words, is not displaying the ability to point to familiar objects and people, does not notice when a caregiver leaves or returns, or loses skills they once had, a parent or caregiver should schedule a developmental screening with their pediatrician. ', ' Empathy involves understanding what another person may be feeling, and then feeling or imagining a similar emotion. Research suggests that children clearly display empathy by about 18 months of age, often taking action to help an adult who seems to be struggling with a task or comforting a parent or caregiver who seems sad or distressed. For children who may be highly sensitive, taking on others’ emotions may be easy, even if it’s sometimes overwhelming; for other children, research shows, parents who talk about emotions, openly and often, can help them develop higher levels of empathy—along with, of course, modeling empathy at home. ', ' Yes, even if it’s harder when they are tired or overwhelmed. Research shows that, before turning 2, children will share their food with others, even a stranger—and even if they are hungry themselves. Evolutionary psychologists believe that “altruistic food transfer” is a key behavior that separates humans from other primates, one that fosters group cohesion and, in a larger sense, the success of the community and the species. ', ' Toddlerhood has long also been known as “the terrible twos,” because children often struggle to manage their emotions and behavior at this age. But it is also the stage when kids begin to play with each other, and recent research has shown that, contrary to their reputation, toddlers respect and favor fair play. Watching pretend scenes in which one puppet won a conflict because another puppet got out of its way or otherwise deferred to it, toddlers reported that they liked the winning puppet better. But when the winning puppet ended a conflict by pushing the other puppet out of the way, toddlers did not like the winner more. ', ' They can certainly try, and if they show an interest, parents should let them (within reason). A large body of research shows that virtually all toddlers who watch a parent or caregiver do chores will make gestures to help or copy them. This desire to help out, researchers believe, is nearly universal, but many parents mistakenly do not allow it, often because they believe the toddler may get hurt, may create more work for the adult, or just slow things down. And when parents do ask toddlers to help, they often recruit them with the promise of a reward, quashing their instinct to chip in just to be helpful.

They can also be expected to throw tantrums when those bids are denied. ', ' What are the key milestones of toddler development?  What are signs of developmental concern during toddlerhood?  How can parents promote empathy in toddlers?  Can toddlers share?  How do toddlers manage conflict?  Can toddlers help around the house?  Why do toddlers get scared?  How many words do children need to hear?  Can a parent detect dyslexia in a toddler? ', ' Most children take their first steps during this period, before tackling stairs and starting to run. They begin to undress themselves, to eat with utensils and drink from cups, to throw a ball (or whatever else is handy), and draw straight lines and circles.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, one- and two-year-olds can also be expected to display most of the following social and cognitive skills, although each child develops differently and may achieve some milestones earlier or later than others and still be considered to be experiencing healthy development:  Social Development  Hand things to others as a form of play.  Have temper tantrums.  Display a fear of strangers.  Show affection to familiar people.  Engage in pretend play, like feeding a doll.  Cling to caregivers in new situations.  Point to show things to others.  Explore alone, but with parents or caregivers within sight.  Copy others.  Show excitement to be around other children.  Express defiance, such as when told not to do something.  Play mostly beside other children, but begin to include others in games like chase.  Cognitive Development and Communication Skills  Point to get attention and show someone what they want.  Say several single words, including “no,” and, eventually, form sentences of two-to-four words.  Understand the purpose of common objects like phones, brushes, and spoons.  Show the ability to point to specific body parts.  Scribble on their own.  Follow 1-step verbal requests without any gestures (“sit down”) and, eventually, two-step commands.  Point to things or pictures when they are named, including in books, and begin to name them themselves.  Recognize the names of familiar people.  Repeat words overheard in conversation.  Find things even when hidden under two or three covers.  Begin to sort shapes and colors.  Complete familiar sentences and rhymes.  Play simple make-believe games.  Build towers of 4 or more blocks.  Start to favor a dominant hand. ', ' If a child in late toddlerhood is not walking steadily, copying others, following simple instructions, or gaining new words, is limited to fewer than 6 words, is not displaying the ability to point to familiar objects and people, does not notice when a caregiver leaves or returns, or loses skills they once had, a parent or caregiver should schedule a developmental screening with their pediatrician. ', ' Empathy involves understanding what another person may be feeling, and then feeling or imagining a similar emotion. Research suggests that children clearly display empathy by about 18 months of age, often taking action to help an adult who seems to be struggling with a task or comforting a parent or caregiver who seems sad or distressed. For children who may be highly sensitive, taking on others’ emotions may be easy, even if it’s sometimes overwhelming; for other children, research shows, parents who talk about emotions, openly and often, can help them develop higher levels of empathy—along with, of course, modeling empathy at home. ', ' Yes, even if it’s harder when they are tired or overwhelmed. Research shows that, before turning 2, children will share their food with others, even a stranger—and even if they are hungry themselves. Evolutionary psychologists believe that “altruistic food transfer” is a key behavior that separates humans from other primates, one that fosters group cohesion and, in a larger sense, the success of the community and the species. ', ' Toddlerhood has long also been known as “the terrible twos,” because children often struggle to manage their emotions and behavior at this age. But it is also the stage when kids begin to play with each other, and recent research has shown that, contrary to their reputation, toddlers respect and favor fair play. Watching pretend scenes in which one puppet won a conflict because another puppet got out of its way or otherwise deferred to it, toddlers reported that they liked the winning puppet better. But when the winning puppet ended a conflict by pushing the other puppet out of the way, toddlers did not like the winner more. ', ' They can certainly try, and if they show an interest, parents should let them (within reason). A large body of research shows that virtually all toddlers who watch a parent or caregiver do chores will make gestures to help or copy them. This desire to help out, researchers believe, is nearly universal, but many parents mistakenly do not allow it, often because they believe the toddler may get hurt, may create more work for the adult, or just slow things down. And when parents do ask toddlers to help, they often recruit them with the promise of a reward, quashing their instinct to chip in just to be helpful. ', ' Fear is not innate in humans, many researchers believe (the fear of creatures like spiders and snakes may be an exception), but is instead learned, typically in late infancy and early toddlerhood. For most children, their first fear is of strangers, strange places, or the departure of parents or caregivers. Some fears are conditioned—being “attacked” by an aggressive or overly enthusiastic or affectionate dog, for example. Others fears are learned by example, such as seeing a parent’s fearful reaction to blood. ', ' Research has long suggested that significant differences in eventual academic success emerge between children who hear more words in their homes at a young age, and those who don’t. More recent studies find that the differences can be vast: Some adults use as few as 400 words in a 90-minute period with a child, while others use as many as 9,000. But another key difference emerged from these studies: the importance of the diversity of the words a child hears. Children whose parents or caregivers used a wider range of words, including difficult words and even nonsense words, appeared to have an academic advantage later, even if they hadn’t heard the highest volume of words. ', ' Dyslexia, which involves difficulty with accurate word recognition, as well as poor decoding and spelling, affects 10-15 percent of children. Effective intervention and instruction can help children with dyslexia manage and excel in school, but early detection is greatly beneficial and many signs tend to emerge in toddlerhood. Parents should be aware of struggles with phonological awareness skills—in other words, if a child fails to match letter names to their corresponding sounds, or has trouble blending sounds into larger words, recognizing rhymes, or pronouncing common words.

At this age, many children will have their first formal learning experiences—including learning to socialize with others without a parent present. In some cases, parents may have to deal with a child’s aggression toward others, or with helping them deal with other children’s aggression toward them. Caregivers can take advantage of children’s openness to learning at this age by continuing to read to them often and conversing with them on a wide range of topics while introducing new words and ideas to them. ', ' What are the key milestones of early childhood development?  Is personality locked in during early childhood?  How do young children learn to share?  How much play time do kids need?  Why can young children sometimes be aggressive, or even mean?  Why do some tantrums last so long?  What makes some children shy?  What do children learn from picture books?  How does conversation help children’s brains develop? ', ' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, by the end of early childhood, at about age 5, children can be expected to display most of the following social and cognitive skills, although each child develops differently and may achieve some milestones earlier or later than others and still be considered to be experiencing healthy development:  Social Development  Prefers playing with others to playing alone.  Wants to please friends, and be like their friends.  More likely to understand and follow rules.  Likes to sing, dance, and act.  Is aware of gender.  Can tell what’s real and what’s make-believe.  Displays, and seeks, more independence in and out of the home.  Is sometimes demanding and sometimes very cooperative.  Cognitive Development and Communication Skills  Speaks clearly.  Tells a simple story using full sentences.  Uses future tense; for example, “Grandma will be here.”  Can say their name and address.  Can count 10 or more things.  Can draw a person with at least 6 body parts.  Can print many letters or numbers, and reproduce geometric shapes.  Knows about things used every day, like money and food. ', ' No. Early childhood is a crucial developmental stage, but the idea that personality is set in stone at this age is easily disproved. Children raised in abusive homes, for example, can grow to be emotionally healthy. And adults who have long struggled with anxiety can learn to change through psychotherapy, a field built on the idea that we can change if we really desire to do so. Parents should still do all they can to create a stable emotional environment and foster their children’s intelligence and social skills, which can benefit them throughout their lives. But biological and environmental factors beyond a parent’s control can negatively affect a child, and so parents also should not imagine that every struggle a child ever faces can be tracked to mistakes they made in early childhood. ', ' Preschoolers are often selfish, holding onto coveted resources whenever they have the opportunity and resisting pleas to share, even though they know it’s the right thing to do. It doesn’t mean young children are jerks; other research shows that they are highly empathetic, quickly offering comfort to those in distress. Sharing toys, however, or understanding the concept of giving to help others in need may require parental guidance. Fortunately, the evidence is clear that kids can learn to share and that, like adults, helping others makes them feel good, just as it does for adults. Parents who can explain the benefits of sharing, successfully model the behavior, and convey their good feelings at being generous, are most likely to help their children acquire the habit of sharing. ', ' Children need much more than they usually get. Studies have found that children today spend less time engaged in creative or free play, especially outside, than they did in the past, for reasons including increased time spent on digital media, parental or household routines that don’t allow for free play, and heightened concerns over safety and a decreased willingness to let children play outside unsupervised. As a result, some advocates argue, kids may be more sedentary, less creative, and less independent, than they could be. ', ' Children act aggressively at an early age: Kids may hit, bite, push, or kick before they turn 18 months old. In early childhood, verbal aggression like teasing and name-calling become more common. Toddlers typically become aggressive because they are angry or afraid but at older ages, when children understand how their actions can affect someone else, aggression becomes more concerning. It’s at this age that bullying behavior begins.  Many bullies, rather than having emotional problems, have high levels of emotional understanding, but may have learned from other experiences that people are generally hostile, and so that not only should they react aggressively to perceived offenses, but that aggression is a reasonable response. Parents and teachers who can take steps to promote empathy can help young children learn to be more understanding of others and to approach social interactions in a healthier way. ', ' Tantrums can be enormously distressing for parents, especially because of their apparent lack of internal logic: Small issues can spark explosions of anger that often continue long after the initial issue has been resolved. It’s important to understand the difference between a tantrum’s trigger and the factors that keep it going. Environmental issues can play a role: A crowded space, for example, especially one in which a child feels on display, can drive their stress further upward. A parent’s response to a tantrum can also extend it, because stress is contagious. When a child misbehaves, and a parent shouts, the child can become even more stressed, and both can become inflexible, fueling a lengthy tantrum cycle. When parents can recognize this cycle, they can step out of it, helping the child calm down more quickly, and, if necessary, they can further address the behavior later. ', ' Signs of an outgoing or reserved personality can be seen, some research suggests, in children as young as four months: Those who showed the most emotional distress tended to be most likely to develop social anxiety later. But normal shyness in a child is not necessarily a sign of a concern. Temperaments often change as kids get older, and, besides, many people take a little time to warm up to new people and situations. In the meantime, parents can help highly sensitive or anxious children thrive by letting them adjust to new things at their own pace and understanding their internal anxiety, which is often closely tied to a tendency for feeling guilty, by only gently reprimanding them when they break a rule. ', ' More than 60 percent of parents of young children read to them every day, and the benefits are clear, predicting future interest in reading as well as academic achievement. When parents read aloud to their children, they expose them to a range of words and turns of phrase that may not be part of their normal everyday conversations. Kids can learn sophisticated content as well, as a study of their retention of key concepts from books on animal camouflage and evolution showed. Above all, though, children find comfort from hearing their parents’ voices read to them, and thrive on the bonding that reading time enables. ', ' A child’s early exposure to language is at the core of their development, predicting language skills, cognitive ability, and academic achievement. Recent research emphasizes the importance of early conversation in the development of language structures in the brain: The more conversation kids experienced, the stronger the connections between regions of the brain responsible for speech production and comprehension. These findings are part of a body of research suggesting that rich and complex conversational turns are at least as important to language development as the raw number of words a child hears.

Studies have found that children today spend less time engaged in creative or free play, especially outside, than they did in the past, for reasons including increased time spent on digital media, parental or household routines that don’t allow for free play, and heightened concerns over safety and a decreased willingness to let children play outside unsupervised. As a result, some advocates argue, kids may be more sedentary, less creative, and less independent, than they could be. ', ' Children act aggressively at an early age: Kids may hit, bite, push, or kick before they turn 18 months old. In early childhood, verbal aggression like teasing and name-calling become more common. Toddlers typically become aggressive because they are angry or afraid but at older ages, when children understand how their actions can affect someone else, aggression becomes more concerning. It’s at this age that bullying behavior begins.  Many bullies, rather than having emotional problems, have high levels of emotional understanding, but may have learned from other experiences that people are generally hostile, and so that not only should they react aggressively to perceived offenses, but that aggression is a reasonable response. Parents and teachers who can take steps to promote empathy can help young children learn to be more understanding of others and to approach social interactions in a healthier way. ', ' Tantrums can be enormously distressing for parents, especially because of their apparent lack of internal logic: Small issues can spark explosions of anger that often continue long after the initial issue has been resolved. It’s important to understand the difference between a tantrum’s trigger and the factors that keep it going. Environmental issues can play a role: A crowded space, for example, especially one in which a child feels on display, can drive their stress further upward. A parent’s response to a tantrum can also extend it, because stress is contagious. When a child misbehaves, and a parent shouts, the child can become even more stressed, and both can become inflexible, fueling a lengthy tantrum cycle. When parents can recognize this cycle, they can step out of it, helping the child calm down more quickly, and, if necessary, they can further address the behavior later. ', ' Signs of an outgoing or reserved personality can be seen, some research suggests, in children as young as four months: Those who showed the most emotional distress tended to be most likely to develop social anxiety later. But normal shyness in a child is not necessarily a sign of a concern. Temperaments often change as kids get older, and, besides, many people take a little time to warm up to new people and situations. In the meantime, parents can help highly sensitive or anxious children thrive by letting them adjust to new things at their own pace and understanding their internal anxiety, which is often closely tied to a tendency for feeling guilty, by only gently reprimanding them when they break a rule. ', ' More than 60 percent of parents of young children read to them every day, and the benefits are clear, predicting future interest in reading as well as academic achievement. When parents read aloud to their children, they expose them to a range of words and turns of phrase that may not be part of their normal everyday conversations. Kids can learn sophisticated content as well, as a study of their retention of key concepts from books on animal camouflage and evolution showed. Above all, though, children find comfort from hearing their parents’ voices read to them, and thrive on the bonding that reading time enables. ', ' A child’s early exposure to language is at the core of their development, predicting language skills, cognitive ability, and academic achievement. Recent research emphasizes the importance of early conversation in the development of language structures in the brain: The more conversation kids experienced, the stronger the connections between regions of the brain responsible for speech production and comprehension. These findings are part of a body of research suggesting that rich and complex conversational turns are at least as important to language development as the raw number of words a child hears.

Some will enter puberty at this age, girls more likely than boys.  The frequent transitions of this period can be daunting for kids and for parents, but children are more likely to thrive when they are confident that their caregivers remain ready to support their emotional needs. Parents can maintain strong relationships with their kids by remaining engaged with their connection even when their children don’t seem to be (or won't admit to be). Parents may find that even as sons and daughters begin to rebel, they will still listen to their caregivers’ advice, eventually, if it is given calmly and without judgment. \", ' How can kids learn to become more independent decision makers?  Why do children seem to lose motivation as they enter middle school?  How do children develop resilience?  How can a parent tell if a child has enough friends?  How can children manage early puberty?  How does bullying affect children?  What do children need most from their parents as they approach adolescence?  How can a parent tell that a child is depressed?  Does too much screen time affect kids’ mental health? ', ' Metacognition means being aware of one’s own thinking—and experts believe it is crucial for children developing decision making, as it enables planning, monitoring, and evaluation of their responsibilities, school assignments, and schedules. Conscious awareness of one’s challenges in math, for example, can lead to better planning on upcoming assignments, more attention to the results, and greater self-reflection and meaning making. ', ' Often a child who worked hard and was eager to achieve in elementary school seems to slack off and lose interest when they enter upper grades. It’s a normal phenomenon at this stage of development, often driven by frustration with new demands on their organizational and time-management skills; distraction, as social life and bodily change become higher-priority concerns; the effects of bullying or social exclusion; and an embrace of rebellion to authority, represented by teachers. Parents who observe these shifts in their children should reach out with calm, empathy, reassurance, and practical advice, as opposed to judgment or punishment. ', ' Life stressors can weigh particularly heavily on children, who may lack the perspective an adult might bring to a temporary setback. Resilience is not an innate trait; it’s something children can develop. Research has shown that children who are better able to regulate or control their emotions are less likely to become anxious or depressed in stressful times. Supportive relationships with parents and other close adults can boost a child’s resilience, as it gives them the confidence to move forward. ', ' Parents may hope that their children meet whatever definition of “popular” they subscribe to, but like adults, children differ in their social needs: Some are happy to have one or two close friends, while others are anxious may become anxious if they don’t feel like everyone in their class likes them. Like adults, though, few children embrace loneliness, and parents who closely observe their children’s moods and routines, and recognize that they are experiencing loneliness, can support them—not by arranging play dates, but by encouraging participation in group activities and helping them develop social skills. ', ' The American Academy of Pediatrics considers puberty to be early, or “precocious,” if it occurs before age 8 in girls, or age 9 in boys. The average age of puberty onset is about 12 years, although research suggests that this age is gradually shifting earlier for more children than ever before. For these children, changes to their bodies and moods may be especially tumultuous, leading to feelings of awkwardness around peers, discomfort with their bodies, and an unwelcome sense of being an outlier. Girls who reach puberty earlier may be more likely to experience panic attacks, body dissatisfaction, substance abuse, and even suicidality. Researchers refer to these issues as the result of mismatch between one’s physical and emotional development. Early developing boys experience similar stresses due to mismatch, research finds, but generally to a lesser extent as even early puberty tends to arrive later in boys than in girls.  Parents, experts advise, should reassure children that they are still “normal”; they are just reaching a universal milestone slightly ahead of schedule. A parent’s openness to listen to a child’s concerns about any topic, and their ability to remain positive and supportive, can help a child get through this period with their confidence and self-esteem intact.  For more, see Adolescence. ', ' Approximately 20 percent of students report being bullied at school, and boys and girls report being bullied in equal numbers, although with the advent of cyberbullying, those numbers may be rising. As children move past early childhood, they are less likely to tell parents about bullying or ask parents to intervene. Victims can be traumatized by bullying, in ways that may linger into adulthood including shame, lower self-esteem and diminished self-confidence. Children who are bullied may experience it as social rejection, which is why being bullied is a common source of school avoidance.  For more, see Bullying. ', ' Research has long suggested that the most beneficial parenting style for a child’s development is authoritative—high in both warmth and discipline. More recent research investigated which of those factors was more important for healthy development over the lifespan and found that children benefited more strongly from parental warmth, regardless of whether the parent was also high or low in terms of discipline. Love, then, in the form of warmth, forgiveness, and understanding, may be the most important thing a parent can offer their children. ', ' Research suggests that 1 to 3 percent of children experience depression before puberty. Parents should understand that depression is a treatable condition, and that treatment is crucial because, if ignored, depression can recur throughout their child’s life. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to tell that a child is depressed, especially as they approach and enter adolescence and become increasingly less likely to share their feelings with parents. The most common symptom of depression in children is irritability, and a depressed child may also display sadness, lethargy, a lack of interest in their activities, and self-destructive behavior. Parents should let a child know that they are aware of his or her pain and that they want to listen, and to help. Along with seeking professional help, taking part in activities together, like biking or walks, may lessen symptoms by boosting a child’s activity and assuring them that they have support.  For more, see Children and Depression. ', ' Recent research suggests that there could be an effect, but a small one, and that it may not work in the way many people imagine. A study based on surveys of thousands of children ages 9 to 11 revealed a link between screen time and depression in young people, and a lesser connection between screen time and anxiety. It appeared, however, that increased screen time, especially passive time watching videos or other content, was a symptom of depression, not a cause. Gaming and online chatting were more closely linked to anxiety in children, though, again, the link was not necessarily causal and in any event, it was statistically small.

Children, even preschoolers, are not immune to depression. Evidence currently indicates that depression affects 1 to 3 percent of children before puberty. Early-onset depression is a treatable condition, and treatment is urgent for several reasons. If ignored, the early-onset depression can recur through life, and it is associated with such later problems as criminality, substance abuse, and suicidality. Depression in children warrants special attention because the disorder can interfere with the normal course of learning and development, impeding education, the establishment of relationships, and disrupting family life. ', \" What does depression look like in children?  Do children get depressed if a parent is depressed?  Why do children get depressed?  How is depression best treated in children?  Are antidepressant drugs safe for children?  Do children ever outgrow depression?  What's the best way to help a child with depression? \", ' One of the most common symptoms of depression in children is irritability. But children may also show symptoms more like those adults exhibit: sadness, lethargy, lack of interest in and withdrawal from activities once enjoyed, disturbed sleep patterns, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and engaging in self-destructive behavior. That’s especially the case with teenagers. Other children may appear angry and act out frequently. Parents don’t often know when their child is depressed, and children do not always let on to parents that they are emotionally distressed; children may in fact withhold such information in an effort to protect their parents from feeling bad about having a child with a mental illness. ', ' A family history of depression (especially in a parent) can put a child at risk for depression in several ways; there may be genetic transmission of vulnerability, but just as likely depression keeps parents from engaging with children in ways needed for neural development, a sense of security, and a sense of self. Further, depressed parents can unwittingly transmit their negative world view or negative styles of interpreting experience to their children. ', ' Because children are dependent on their parent for most of their needs, a significant source of depression in children is persistent turbulence in the family home or severe familial adversity, such as poverty Abuse or neglect are notable adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that can reset children’s stress response so that even minor upsets can trigger depression. The loss of a parent or beloved caregiver is another source of depression in children, just as is the loss of a significant relationship among adolescents. Bullying is a form of abuse that can give rise to depression in victims. Developmental and learning problems can severely affect children’s sense of self and pave the way for depression. The decline of free play in childhood is another contributor to depression, and it deprives children of an important source of joy. Among teenagers, there is mounting evidence that social media can have profoundly negative effects on mental health,  especially among girls. Teens increasingly report they feel lonely; they spend more time communicating electronically, less time face-to-face interacting with friends. ', ' Early detection and treatment of depression is important, because the longer depression goes untreated, the harder it is to treat. Medication is often prescribed for children with depression, but its effectiveness is very much a matter of debate, and many studies show that it is little more effective than a placebo. Moreover, the long-term effects of medication on the developing brain are unknown. On the other hand, psychotherapy of children, especially in conjunction with parents, is consistently shown to have a large and lasting effect on depressive symptoms in children. Evidence suggests that the most effective treatment for childhood depression involves some form of psychotherapy, with or without medication. The younger children are, the more important it is for them to be treated in conjunction with a parent—dyadic therapy. There is evidence that therapy specifically focused on parent-child interaction patterns can alleviate depression in children aged 3 to7—and in the parents as well. For older children, both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which aims to correct the negative thinking patterns that underlie depression, and interpersonal therapy (IPT), which looks at children in the context of their relationships, have lasting therapeutic value. ', ' Few mental health topics have inspired as much controversy as the use of antidepressant drugs in children and, arguably to a lesser extent, in teens. Antidepressant medications carry a so-called black-box warning that the drugs may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 25. What’s more, no antidepressants are approved for use in children under 8. Nevertheless, there are times when the benefits of antidepressants outweigh the risks. Antidepressants work best when their use is regularly monitored by a psychiatrist and the treated child is carefully observed by parents. ', ' Ignoring depression or expecting it to go away on its own is never a wise policy, particularly in children. If untreated, an episode of depression lasts an average of four to eight months. That can have major effects on a child’s learning and on relationships in the family and with peers. Further, untreated or incompletely treated depression sets children up for repeated bouts of depression later in life. Among teens, whose depression may be related more to their expanding social sensitivities than among younger children, 50 percent of those who experience one episode of depression will never experience another. ', ' Aim for fast and effective action. Both the quality of parent-child communication and the tone of the family environment are important. If there are tensions in the household, seek to address and reduce them, even if it means marital therapy for the parents, Support is crucial. Let a child know you are aware of their struggles, that they are not alone, and demonstrate willingness to listen when they want to talk. Parents can help children understand their feelings by putting names to them and distinguishing one from the other, such as sadness and loneliness; knowing what someone is feeling is a requirement for knowing what remedial steps are necessary. Parents can also help spot and bring awareness of a child to the negative self-talk that can trigger a downward emotional spiral. Going for walks or bike rides with a child has special value: It not only counters lethargy and presents opportunities for nurturing the parent-child bond, but outdoor activity is itself beneficial and involves exposure to sunlight, a natural antidepressant.

Find a therapist to help with ADHD ', ' Kids with ADHD may seem unruly at times, but the behavior is not necessarily intentional, nor simple for them to control.  How adults respond to kids\\' ADHD can shape their self-view and dictate whether conduct disturbances develop.  Telling an ADHD child to \"behave\" or that they need \"to just focus\" doesn\\'t consider their internal experience and can engender defensiveness.  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) needs little introduction. Restless, impulsive, inattentive, and distractible children with low frustration tolerance are believed to account for 4-5 percent of people aged 6-18 (e.g., Sayal et al., 2018; Mohammadi et al., 2019). Further (i.e., Sayal et al., 2018), it is believed another 5 percent exhibit symptoms considered sub-threshold of the full diagnosis.  With these numbers, chances are you have crossed paths with people with ADHD, especially if you work in healthcare or schools, and it might be frustrating at times. Even people who are prescribed ADHD medication do not have symptom remission. Prescriptions can help, but intensity can remain.  If you find being in the presence of someone who’s distractible and in constant motion challenging, imagine that experience from the inside out, with no reprieve. Now, imagine trying to get through your day as such, only to be barraged with messages that instill a sense of being flawed and/or “bad.” ', ' It’s no secret that kids (and even adults) with ADHD are inundated with reactions from others, well-meaning and otherwise, that instill a sense of marginalization and deprecation that only serves to deepen their conflicts. On the more innocuous end of the spectrum, children with ADHD often feel depressed because it is such a struggle to keep up with peers, and they don’t feel like they fit in. On the more toxic end of the spectrum, conduct disorder is not an unusual co-occurrence when ADHD kids are treated as “bad.”  To understand the latter, consider that kids with ADHD are often told to behave and are meted out reprimands or reacted to negatively at school, home, or both for something they have no control over (e.g., Bjornebekk et al., 2015). Feeling little control over their internal or external environment and unfairly aggressed, they may gain a sense of control by becoming the aggressor. Then, they are no longer the victim in their mind, and being an aggressor also punishes those who they perceived as wronging them.  Having never felt empathized with, as noted by famed personality expert Stuart Yudofsky (2005), they may reason, “I’m not going to give what I never got.” This, of course, makes it easier to remain offensive and maintain that sense of omnipotent control. Add to this that, at baseline, they are likely impulsive, stimulation-seeking, and risk-takers, making it hard to control their frustrated reactions, and it is easy to see how they may react with conduct disturbances like fighting, running, and theft.  It has been established that the way others respond to children with ADHD can have a big impact on whether they develop other behavioral complications (e.g., Bjornebekk et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2019). This is important not only for the child but for society because the trajectory of children with Conduct Disorder is correlated to adult sociopathy (e.g., Storebo et al., 2016; NICE, 2017; APA, 2022). ', ' People who encounter kids with ADHD are frequently guilty of two phrases that ultimately add to their frustration and contribute to a negative self-perception and possibly conduct issues. If you know someone with ADHD, or you encounter such individuals on the job and aren’t sure what to say, avoiding the following two phrases will likely up your game, especially if replaced with the suggested alternatives. ', ' What Is ADHD?  Find a therapist to help with ADHD  1. “Will you behave?”  Often muttered by frustrated caretakers as their ADHD child fidgets off the Richter Scale, touching everything they were told not to, this utterance implies that the kid is being intentionally oppositional and mischievous, and thus “bad.” It must be remembered, though, that it is in the nature of ADHD for children not to have fully heard what you said, to have quickly forgotten what was asked of them, and, perhaps even harder, to control their penchant for simply gravitating towards anything that looks interesting to play with.  Instead, practice recognizing that what appears as opposition is not personal nor necessarily intentional. There’s a good chance that being accusatory will only escalate the matter as the kid tries to stick up for themselves, which is perceived by the frustrated adult as further opposition, fueling an unproductive cycle. Approaching the child with a more understanding offering, perhaps firmly if need be for emphasis, such as, “I know there’s a lot going on all around, and it’s hard to keep contained in situations like this, but I’ve seen you do it before. We’re almost done.” ', \" This statement sends a more supportive message, letting them know you recognize their struggle but reminding them they have the ability to keep it together and that the overstimulating situation is not forever. While this approach may not be a perfect antidote, it at least spares the child from feeling embarrassed and deviant and likely from escalating the situation into an argument.  2. “I just need you to stop and focus.”  If it were that easy, they’d “just” do it. The child doesn’t want to be distracted any more than a teacher or parent wants them to be. Adding insult to injury, it tends to be delivered in an authoritarian or patronizing manner with an implied finger wag. Imagine being on the receiving end of that when you’re doing the best you can despite your mind being a pinball machine.  “I just need you to stop and focus” can send a message that if only the kid wanted to, if they weren’t being so devious, they could reign it in and be as attentive as a surgeon. Naturally, the kid’s attention may continue shifting, only frustrating the requester, who becomes more commanding. This is the equivalent of speaking louder and slower in your native tongue to someone foreign in the hopes they’ll finally understand you.  Instead of seeing them as uncooperative, it is more productive if we can learn to cooperate with them. I recently evaluated a young teen who was literally under the table, on the windowsill, and sitting in all the different chairs in the room as I interviewed them. Ideally, they would’ve remained seated for a more linear discussion, but allowing them to engage their need for stimulation actually kept them better focused for the discussion. It was as if the whole room was their fidget spinner. Trying to control their impulse to move and pay attention to the conversation would’ve proven too burdensome, and they’d naturally err to the physical need.  If you are a parent, teacher, or helping professional and encounter children whose ADHD is particularly challenging, and you find yourself reactive to it, parent retraining (one doesn’t have to be a parent to attend) could prove a useful endeavor (e.g., Rapaselli, 2018; Hornstra et al., 2021).

Find a therapist near me ', \" The way parents approach feeding their kids can impact whether their child might use food to deal with emotions in helpful or unhelpful ways.  Emotional eating that's short-term and situational can be healthy and normal.  Using food to chronically avoid unpleasant or uncomfortable emotions can be problematic.  On my 16th birthday, my mother did a rare thing: she took the day off of work.  On that cold Friday morning in March, we got in her car and drove one town over. She pulled over to the curb, about 200 feet from a busy intersection, grabbed her purse, got out, and turned back with a wink and a wave. As I moved into the driver's seat, a stern-looking man with a clipboard joined me as a passenger. Less than 30 minutes later, my mother and I were cruising down the interstate together again and she was asking me what I wanted to do next.  To this day, I'm not sure what I was more excited about at that moment: having finally earned myself an official driver's license, or the fact that my mother was, clearly, playing hooky for the rest of the day so we could celebrate with a special lunch.  I chose a restaurant called Grandma's, known for its decadent desserts. Over 30 years have passed since that day, yet I still feel giddy remembering those slices of steamy apple pie we enjoyed together in that cozy booth. \", \" Eating is an intrinsically emotional experience. It involves memories, associations, and traditions, and is often done together with loved ones. Almost everyone can relate to using food to mark an emotionally-charged moment. Whether it's to add joy to a celebratory milestone, such as a birthday, graduation, or wedding, or to offer reassurance during moments of stress, sickness, or loss, we all use food in one way or another to enhance or soothe emotion.  Despite what fitness professionals and weight loss experts tell us, emotional eating is nothing to fear or cure. In fact, normalizing emotional eating can help improve our children's relationship with food as well as their nutritional health.  Raising our children to understand emotional eating helps them avoid the unnecessary guilt, remorse, and shame that often accompany it when we fear it is unhealthy or wrong. It also helps them avoid the negative effects of parental food restriction, which creates emotional chaos and binge eating behaviors that crowd out room in kids' bellies and diets, increasing the odds they'll miss out on important nutrients. \", ' While parents don\\'t need to panic if their child is snacking more to deal with the stress of exam week, or baking batches of cookies to soothe the sadness of an important peer relationship that\\'s turned rocky, if eating is the only way they can deal with uncomfortable or intense emotions then it needs to be addressed.  In my practice, I call this \"evasive eating.\" Emotional eating that\\'s short-term and situational is appropriate, normal, and even helpful. However, emotional eating that occurs consistently over the long term can be harmful, unhealthy, and even have a negative impact on nutritional health.  Here are some ways to be more understanding about your child\\'s emotional eating as well as increase protection against evasive eating. ', ' Research suggests that the more you restrict your child, the higher the chances they will go overboard on certain foods when a negative emotion or stress strikes. This is especially important to think about if you’re a parent who has been trying to limit foods for fear of weight gain—the more your child is feeling stressed about their eating or how you and others perceive their eating or weight, the more likely they might be to binge on food when anxiety, stress, or worry strikes. ', ' What Contributes to Appetite?  Find a therapist near me ', ' The more relaxed you feel about enjoying celebratory foods or indulging in comforting food when needed, the less likely you\\'ll experience the negative side effects that commonly (and necessarily) accompany emotional eating. In other words, if you do decide to have a bowl of creamy mac and cheese after a stressful or draining day, choosing to view it as a positive act of self-care as opposed to a food slip-up, will go a long way in protecting you from guilt and shame. It\\'ll also help ensure you get the soothing benefit you were seeking from it in the first place.  We, as parents, unwittingly communicate our own negative bias toward long-maligned meals, dishes, and desserts to our children without realizing it. With this in mind, focusing on improving our own beliefs about what foods or eating behaviors are \"healthy\" or \"unhealthy\" can go a long way in helping our children have less disordered and more well-adjusted relationships with food of their own. If you can neutralize negative attitudes you have towards traditionally taboo, yet celebratory or comforting foods, your child will be able to enjoy them without unnecessary, internal conflict as they grow. ', \" Instead of worrying about how much or which foods your child eats when they're emotional, try paying closer attention to how well they're able to label and talk about their emotions instead. You can do this by checking in with them on a day-to-day basis or right before or after a meal or snack.  For example, is your child able to identify and share what kind of day they've had or name a prominent emotion they're feeling? If they're indulging in food for comfort, can they also talk about what’s bothering them? Or is the emotion as deeply buried as those chocolate bar wrappers under their bed? From my experience, children who are more communicative about their feelings are less likely to rely on food as a way to cope on a regular basis. \", ' Remember, these tips aren’t meant to prevent emotional eating. Rather they are meant to help you better understand that emotional eating can be normal—and to explain how making it forbidden might backfire.  If you suspect your child is relying on food as a way to avoid dealing with difficult emotions such as anxiety, boredom, depression, or stress for a long period of time, it\\'s important to enlist the help of a psychotherapist who can help them work through the underlying problem. This approach will be more effective than focusing on trying to get them to eat less, or \"healthier.\"  To find a therapist near you, visit the Psychology Today Therapy Directory.

Find a therapist near me ', ' Painfully shy children often miss out on life-changing experiences.  Teaching shy children to be more confident and assertive helps prepare them for the next development phase of life.  There are some simple steps parents can take that can help their shy child feel secure and behave with confidence.  Shy children are at greater risk, when compared to outgoing children, of being bullied, feeling insecure, having bouts of chronic sadness, giving in to peer pressure, and having anxiety.  What’s more, the shy child who has grown into adulthood is likely to remain insecure and socially withdrawn, research finds. If their early experiences included significant verbal bullying then they are more likely, as an adult, to be at risk for alcohol dependence or abuse. They are also more likely to delay getting married and fail to advance as far within their careers as their non-shy peers.  Many mothers and fathers feel at a loss regarding how to help their very shy child. When pressed to act more independently, the child frequently freezes in fear—or tears begin to well up and lower lips begin to tremble.  At this point, it can feel cruel to insist that the child do whatever was asked (say hello to an adult, speak to a waitress when ordering a meal, play independently on the playground, go to a friend’s house for a play date, and so forth). Consequently, many mothers and fathers step in and \"save\" their child from the distress.  Unfortunately, what the child tends to learn from this is that he or she does not need to act more independently. Even worse, many children will see being \"saved\" as a sign that their parents don’t think they are capable of doing what was asked. That often leads to greater insecurity, and an increased tendency to avoid what makes them uncomfortable. ', ' As with many parenting dilemmas, the solution is straightforward. Push your shy child to act with greater assertiveness. Be kind, be patient, but be unrelenting in this regard.  Giving in to the temptation to save your son or daughter from the momentary distress of facing their insecurities may seem loving, but the truth is such actions do them a great disservice. Your child needs to be prepared for the future. And despite the many unknowns about the future, one thing is certain: Your child is headed into the world of adolescence followed by adulthood. Neither of these destinations favors the insecure and shy individual.  To thrive requires the ability to assert oneself. Children who have not learned how to appropriately do so are at a severe disadvantage. The weight of this challenge becomes even heavier upon entering adulthood.  Just as you would teach your child survival skills if you knew he/she was going to be left alone in the woods for several days, it is similarly necessary that you teach your child the skills needed to navigate the world of adulthood. This requires that your son or daughter learn to effectively deal with shyness.  The major stumbling block you will face when attempting to help your child is the same one most parents face: putting aside the urge to save your youngster from anxiety.  Buck up. Your child is counting on you. ', ' The best way to help your shy child become more confident is by having him, or her, behave as though they already felt bold and self-assured. This means you will need to develop a plan that involves a series of assertiveness steps, each one being somewhat more challenging than the one that came before.  For example, you may decide that your shy 7-year-old son needs to begin this journey by learning to say hello to adults. This may seem like a small insignificant skill, but it is the start of him learning to be comfortable speaking with grownups. That means it takes on extra importance. You want him to succeed, to gain confidence and momentum. ', ' What Is Shyness?  Find a therapist near me  Begin by explaining to your son that you very much want him to be able to meet others and not feel anxious. With that in mind, you are going to teach him how to do this, and by the time he has learned this skill, he will feel terrific.  Your son thinks this is a bad idea, but you don’t argue or go into lengthy explanations. Instead, you move on to teach the basic skill of how to say hello to adults.  “OK, so the next time we meet one of my co-workers I want you to look them in the eye, put your hand out, and say ‘Hello, it’s nice to meet you.’ That’s it! Six words, a look in the eye, and a handshake. Got it?”  Your son thinks you have lost your mind, but he nods in agreement anyway.  You add, “Now we are going to practice.” At this point, you tell your son that he is to walk into the room pretending to be the adult. You will pretend to be a child, and you proceed to act out the brief encounter. ', \" This is modeling the desired behavior. It helps if he sees what you want him to do before he tries it himself.  “Terrific. See how easy that was?” Unimpressed your son remains quiet.  “Now it’s time for you to give it a try.” You leave the room, walk in again, and wait for your son to go through the eye contact, hand extension, and ‘Hello, it’s nice to meet you'” sequence.  Be prepared to repeat this several times. Don’t insist on perfection. Getting it close is fine. This is the practice phase.  Now you arrange to take your son to work (or anywhere else you can introduce him to someone new). As long as your son tries to perform the steps you taught him, count it as a success. Praise him for the effort.  Then repeat—as often as possible. Keep repeating until it becomes boring to him. Then move on to the next step.  What is the next step? There are many possibilities. It might be to have him place his own order when you go to a restaurant. Or to purchase something at a store and say hello to the clerk. Maybe it will be to invite a friend over for a playdate.  With each child, the next step (and even the first step) may differ. The main idea is to continue to choose a slightly more challenging situation that will grow your son or daughter’s skills and confidence.  Before he is tasked with performing each step, go through the modeling step. It’s your job to help him be prepared.  After he attempts the step, provide some encouragement. “Good job” or “I’m proud of you” goes a long way to increase motivation. \", ' There are many opportunities for building confidence, including:  Joining a sports team, dance class, Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts, etc.  Asking questions in class  Helping when you volunteer at a charity or church  Assigning chores at home (and insisting that they be done on time and correctly)  Writing thank you notes after receiving gifts  Joining a local theater group (standing on stage in front of an audience can be tough!)  Running an errand such as asking a neighbor to borrow something  Answering the door to accept a package  Joining a school club/organization (yearbook club, school newspaper, etc.) ', ' For a child with mild shyness, it may take only a few months to develop much greater confidence. Extremely shy children, however, may require this sort of active guidance and encouragement throughout childhood and into adolescence. If this is the case, you will likely find that over time, your youngster will begin to set up his/her own series of steps for overcoming the specific challenges shyness raises in each new developmental phase (for example, overcoming shyness related to dating, going to school dances, job interviews and so forth). ', ' Occasional failure is a certainty. When developing a new skill everyone makes mistakes. One of the keys to becoming confident is learning that failure is not a catastrophic event. Shy children tend to exaggerate the consequences of making mistakes and looking foolish.  But the experience of failure provides the antidote to that fear. It proves that speaking up, asserting yourself, and having things go badly is not the end of the world. Life moves on. No one really cares too much. This, in turn, helps the shy child begin to see that the risk of being assertive is not so great after all. ', ' The benefits of overcoming shyness are enormous. Conversely, the risks attached to lacking confidence and assertiveness when entering adolescence and young adulthood are significant.  Evidence suggests that your child is unlikely to outgrow shyness on his/her own. This means it is up to you, the parent, to take action. Building confidence in your child requires time, and it will take a little additional effort. But it’s not complicated, nor is it overly demanding.  What your child receives from your efforts, however, are benefits that last a lifetime.

Deep breaths, mama. Here's what to know.  By          Erica Graham and          Jessica D'Argenio Waller, MS, CNS, LDN          Updated April 4, 2022  A version of this post was originally published on February 10, 2020. It has been updated. \", \" Receptive language and expressive language  Language development milestones for babies 0 to 3 months  Language development milestones for babies 3 to 12 months  Language development milestones for babies 12 to 24 months  What if my child is not babbling or speaking as they should?  What can I do to encourage my child's speech development?  Your baby’s first word is an exciting milestone, both for your child and for you. While you’re eagerly listening for your child’s first words, phrases and sentences, it can be hard not to feel a bit anxious, especially if it seems like other children the same age are talking before yours. When do babies start talking? Why isn’t my child speaking yet? Are they developing normally? Am I doing something wrong?  Deep breaths, mama. Every child reaches verbal milestones at their own pace, and there’s a wide range of “normal.” In fact, most developmental milestones are simply general guidelines. Some babies will reach them early and some later.  While it’s helpful to understand what’s considered typical, if a child has not reached a milestone by a specified age, it does not mean there’s an immediate cause for concern. It just means you’ll want to keep a close eye on how your child’s language is developing and consult your pediatrician or a pediatric speech pathologist with your observations.  Related: How to be a good mom: How to ditch perfectionism & embrace being ‘good enough’  “Every child’s developmental timeline is different,” shares Leanne Sherred, MS, CCC-SLP, and president and co-founder of Expressable, an online speech therapy platform. “And while you shouldn’t stress over how your child’s communication is progressing, you should be aware of it. It may be tempting to take a ‘wait and see’ approach to your child’s speech and language development. However, by doing so you run the risk of having these issues persist and possibly worsen over time. That’s why it’s so important to speak with a speech-language pathologist if you suspect your child is not reaching age-appropriate goals,” she notes.  Here’s what to know about when babies start talking, including typical speech and language development milestones to watch for. \", ' As their speech and language skills develop, children should demonstrate progress in both receptive language (understanding what is being said to them) and expressive language (communicating wants, needs and thoughts). “It’s vital that parents remain informed of typical speech milestones and whether their toddler is reaching communication goals expected of their age. These benchmarks can help parents determine if their baby is on the right track or may need some extra help,” explains Sherred.  The guidelines below outline what’s considered typical by age, according to the American Speech-Language and Hearing Association.  Related: CDC and AAP just changed developmental milestone guidelines for the first time in decades ', ' It seems like newborns and young infants do little else other than eat, sleep and poop, but speech and language development actually begins the day a child is born, long before a baby’s first words are ever spoken, notes Sherred. “Nonverbal communication milestones, like babbling, gesturing, smiling, waving, and even responding to sounds are all good indicators of how a child is progressing.”  Receptive language: Infants should show signs of hearing, such as recognizing a familiar person’s voice and startling in response to loud sounds.  Expressive language: Babies should also be testing their own voices by crying and cooing. As they grow, they will begin to react to different types of sounds and increase the variety of sounds they are making, especially when spoken to.  Related: Yes, it’s normal if your baby doesn’t crawl ', ' So much can happen in this nine-month span. The best way to encourage speech and language development at this stage is all about face time and daily narration. “Children learn language by absorbing and interacting with the world around them—and no one spends more time with your child than their primary caregivers!” says Sherred. “Narrating your daily life is a great way to build a language-rich environment for your child. Talking about what you’re doing out loud provides children with constant exposure to sights and sounds, and helps them start making connections between words and the real world.”  Receptive language: By 1 year, children should show signs of simple receptive language skills that include recognizing simple words for everyday items, reacting to their name, looking where you point, playing simple games and attending to short activities and stories.  Expressive language: Children up to 1 year old often babble repetitive syllables such as “bababa” or “mamama” and use gestures to express what they want. Typically, they may try to repeat your words and may have a couple words in their vocabulary by the end of their first year.  Related: Three-month-old baby sleep guides & schedules ', ' Regular routines involving play, reading and songs can foster a positive environment for language development.  Receptive language: Between the ages of 1 to 2, children will begin to point to body parts when asked, respond to simple directions and questions, and point to familiar pictures and objects when asked.  Expressive language: This is also the age when children begin to blossom with new words, especially around 18 months to 2 years. It is common for children to have 50 words or so by the time they are 2 years old. They will also begin to use two-word phrases and questions and may make animal sounds such as ‘moo’ and use pronouns, like ‘mine’. ', ' “Children don’t come with a handbook, and knowing whether they’re reaching communication milestones typical for their age isn’t always apparent. If you notice your child is having difficulty expressing their wants and needs, or trailing behind other kids their age, you should speak with your pediatrician or a speech-language pathologist,” Sherred says.  Many factors can contribute to a child’s not reaching these speech milestones exactly on time, and it’s important to remember that missing a developmental milestone doesn’t necessarily indicate a speech-language disorder. However, if there is a delay, it is essential to speak to your pediatrician and a speech-language pathologist. For children who may not outgrow delayed speech, early intervention is critical. “Speech and language habits become more ingrained over time, and errors are harder to correct the longer they persist. The earlier your child receives intervention, the more progress they’ll make towards their goals,” Sherred explains.  If at any age, you have concerns your child is not hearing, speak to your pediatrician immediately. Difficulty hearing at a young age can significantly affect a child’s development in various ways. Keep in mind children who pass hearing tests as babies can still develop hearing problems later.  Related: These 7 Montessori phrases are perfect for school AND home ', ' There are multiple ways parents and caregivers can help nurture your child’s speech development.  Look at your child when you are talking. Children learn through observation and imitation. Let them see your face as you make early babbling sounds. Focus on early developing sounds such as b, p, d, m and vowels.  Sing songs. Sing songs or rhymes regularly with your child, and encourage them to join in on the fun. “Children love music, especially when it involves movement, and it helps teach the rhythm of language,” says Sherred.  Respond to your baby. When your little one makes faces or sounds, respond to them by mimicking their actions or by having a simple conversation. Your child will learn that gestures and words receive reactions, an important concept for early communication skills.  Take advantage of routine moments. Life with kids is busy, and it can be challenging to set aside time to work on communication. However, everyday routines can provide perfect opportunities. Talk to your child and practice speech and language skills by narrating your actions during daily activities such as diaper changes, feedings, shopping cart rides and baths.  Modeling language. This simple technique involves using language that is one step above your child’s current skill level, Sherred notes. “If your child is crying to communicate their wants and needs, you’d start gesturing or pointing to their desired item. If they’re already gesturing but not vocalizing, you’d start using single words (like ‘cup’). If they’re using single words, you’d start combining two words into simple phrases (like ‘juice please’ or ‘I want’).”  Purposeful playtime. Playing with your child is one of the most important things you can do to promote their speech and language development, Sherred says. “Playing is a routine that involves engaging in a two-way exchange, just like communication! When playing, start using toys for their intended purposes (like talking into a play phone), find opportunities to practice sounds (saying “vroom” when playing with a car, or “ruff ruff” when playing with a toy dog), and follow your child’s interests.”  Read to your child. Reading is a great way to encourage early communication and narrative skills, as well as a healthy bonding activity for you and your child. “Reading improves so many foundational lifelong skills – like vocabulary, comprehension, and literacy—and is key to academic success. Start with simple picture books and graduate to books with words over time,” Sherred suggests.

It can be an exhausting and frustrating exercise for already tired parents, and one that can require more patience than you ever thought possible. But, like tying shoelaces and buttoning a shirt, potty training has to be learned eventually.  Combing through dozens of potty training methods before you even begin can be tiring in itself (which makes something like child-led potty training sound particularly appealing), so we are always on the lookout for potty training tips, tricks and hacks to make potty training something your child actually wants to try with no prodding necessary.

By          Christina Clemer          July 9, 2020  We independently select and share the products we love—and may receive a commission if you choose to buy. ', \" Here are a few tips to get you through your child's potty training regression:  Successfully potty training your child is no small achievement. Potty training is generally something parents dread, and rightfully so—it’s messy, it makes it hard to leave the house and it can just seem plain overwhelming.  Still, you take the plunge, switch your kid to undies and bask in the glory that is no more diapers. But wait. You move to a new house, you have a new baby—or, hey, you find yourself in the middle of a global pandemic—and the day comes when you find your previously potty-trained child sitting in a pool of pee. Your heart sinks. Back into the trenches of potty training you go.  Just like sleep regressions, potty training regressions are totally normal for small children, especially amidst change. So, first, know you’re not alone. \", ' 1. Avoid shaming.  While it can be frustrating to deal with accidents when you thought your child was fully potty trained, try not to act angry or disappointed. Don’t have a big reaction, as even negative attention can reinforce behavior.  It’s so easy to say, “You’re four! You’ve been doing this for years, how hard can it be?” This can make your child ashamed of themselves and does little to solve the problem.  Instead, try to keep your reaction as neutral as possible. Say something like, “Your clothes are wet, it looks like you peed. Let’s go get some clean clothes.”  The calmer you are, the more you show your child that their regression is normal and that you’re confident they can overcome it.  2. Create a potty routine.  Build in regular bathroom breaks to your daily schedule to help your child be successful. Use natural transitions like after meals, before going to play outside, and before leaving the house for an outing.  Use language like, “After you use the potty, we’ll be able to go to the park,” or, “We always use the potty before we leave the house.” This provides natural motivation for your child to use the toilet if they are looking forward to the next thing.  3. Involve your child in the cleanup.  When your child doesn’t make it to the potty in time, calmly include them in the process of cleaning up.  They can bring you a cleaning cloth or towel to wipe the floor. They can help take their wet clothes off and put them in the laundry basket. Or can choose new clothes from their closet and help put them on.  Involving your child as much as possible will help them take ownership of the process. They will also realize with time, that it takes a lot longer to help clean up an accident than to simply take a potty break in the first place.  4. Offer choices.  One reason children refuse to use the potty is a need to feel in control. This is particularly true when your child is experiencing a big life change. A new house, a new sibling, a new school–all of these changes can be scary and make your child feel like they have no control over their own life.  Offer choices and let your child control some aspects of the toileting process. For example, offer them a fun selection of underwear to choose from. Store the undies somewhere accessible to your child, like a low drawer or basket in the bathroom. If you have multiple bathrooms in your house, let them choose which one to use. Let them choose whether to sit on a little potty or a special seat on the big toilet.  All of these choices are minor and may seem insignificant, but they help your child feel like they have some control over the process of using the toilet, which minimizes the need to boycott the potty altogether.  5. Give extra attention.  Sometimes children regress with potty training because they want more attention from you.  This is particularly true if you have a new baby at home. Your older child will notice the baby getting lots of physical attention, including frequent diaper changes when you drop everything and focus just on the baby.  When possible, try sitting with your child while they use the potty or eat. This isn’t always possible of course, especially if you have a baby at home, but regular one-on-one attention throughout the day can prevent your child from having accidents.  Potty training regression is challenging, but remember that it’s completely normal and will likely pass quickly. If the regression seems to be lingering or you’re concerned that there may be a physical problem, talk with your pediatrician.  6. Be consistent.  If your little one is struggling with accidents, here are some products that have helped us navigate potty training regression with our own kids.

They will also say they want their children to be “kind,” “caring,” “respectful,” and often “successful” and “smart.” These are all values that most of us share. Who wouldn’t want a child to grow up to be kind, caring, successful, and happy?  But can we really make our children happy? Can we force them to be genuinely kind?  No. We really can’t make our kids do anything. We can kiss them, love them, hug them and indulge them. We can sign them up for myriad activities, plan playdates and vacations, give them music lessons, Mandarin classes, gymnastics, soccer, and ballet, and do our utmost to get them into the best schools.  But think about it for a moment—is “happiness” really what we are after anyway?  This drive we have as happy-seeking, often overachieving parents begins early—our plump little babies are allowed to coo, cry, spit up, and awaken us at night until they are about one year and 10 months. Then, whammo! As soon as they reach 2 years old, suddenly and as if overnight, we have a whole new set of rules for them: we want them to behave, listen, follow rules, and “be nice.”  And just as we shift our expectations of our no-longer babies, all hell seems to break loose. A switch is flicked and our sweet little ones turn into demanding, irrational, often defiant toddlers. We worry that if we don’t clamp down on their “bad” behaviors now, they will have these behaviors forever.  It may surprise you to know that parents often—unwittingly, unintentionally—get in the way of their toddlers growing into the well-adjusted, empathetic, resilient, happy older children and adults they envision them to be.  Parents often think they are doing what is best for their children, when in fact, all they are doing is blocking the needs that are at the core of who that child is. And when we suffocate those needs, or even simply overlook them, when we, unwittingly or not, try to mold our children, and shape their behavior according to some preconceived expectations of who they are and who we think they ought to be, we stamp out and smother them. We deny them the crucial foundation necessary for every child to grow up well.  By getting in their way, we can inadvertently sabotage our children’s development in, we take away their ability to understand themselves, to explore the world in a way that makes sense to them and encourages their curiosity. We truncate their motivation to learn. We take away their confidence to forge relationships, and most crucial of all, we interrupt their ability to develop the emotional skills necessary for them to succeed in school and in life.  I don’t mean succeed in the way we tend to think of success these days: that they will become straight-A students, awesome athletes, accomplished artists, or the next great business innovators—though all of that might happen, too.  What I mean by success is this: a person who feels confident to explore the world around him with excitement and curiosity, who is not afraid to make mistakes, who feels secure enough to begin to make friends, and who feels well-adjusted enough to bounce back when she is disappointed. A person who can handle life is motivated to learn, stands up for herself, and cares about others. Sound too good to be true?  Not at all.  Toddlers do or say many things that from an adult point of view appear to be irrational, unsocialized, or even absurd. Indeed, many of our toddlers’ seemingly illogical choices make us parents very nervous. We can get embarrassed.  Our response?  We tend to overcorrect them, or criticize them, or simply stop them. As adults, we see our toddlers’ erratic behavior as needing to be controlled because they seem so out of control, which, from an adult view, they might be. This is when we tend to fall back on generalizations about the classic “terrible twos”—or threes or fours.  We see kids this age as misbehaving or rude or not listening or losing it or throwing temper tantrums over nothing. But when looked at with fresh eyes, these misbehaviors can make sense, even to us. Then you will be able to guide your child through it to a more socialized way of being. Eventually.  So what can parents do? ', ' Mirror back a sense of safety and relative order  Listen to children instead of always talking at and directing them  Give children freedom to play and explore on their own  Allow children the space and opportunity to struggle and fail  Work to understand who each individual child is and what he needs at a given age  Provide children with limits, boundaries, and guidance  These simple actions give any child a strong foundation to grow during a time when they are just beginning to test and understand themselves in relation to others and respond to and manage their complicated feelings.  And guess what happens when we interact with our kids in this way? We suddenly become disentangled from the battles; calm and clear enough to respond to what our child is really needing at any given moment (rather than starting with what the adult needs at that moment); and flexible enough to give our kids choices while at the same time providing support and boundaries.

Tantrums are inevitable and unpredictable, but it’s our jobs as mamas to help our children through them.  We asked Motherly moms to share their number one way to deal with tantrums—and these mom-tested toddler tantrum tips are just too good not to share.  Here’s what to try when your toddler has a tantrum. ', ' “Be your child’s calm in the chaos. I always offer a hug to validate her feelings. Then wait for it to be over before we talk about it. Usually, now she asks for a hug herself.” —Chantelle Hill  2.”I try to see if she can express herself, offer hugs and if she really needs the space. I give her space and let her know mommy is here if she needs me.” — Samantha Peterson  3. “I try to be the “safe” place. We just entered the temper tantrum phase so I’m still learning. Right now, I just calmly sit beside him. I hold my arms out to offer a hug every few minutes to ensure that he knows I’m not mad at him.” — Catherine Abrams ', ' 4. “I sit on the floor with him and wait quietly until he’s ready to reach out for comfort. It’s over in less than two minutes when I do it that way. I reaffirm the emotions he may be feeling, and tell him it’s okay to have those. It’s okay to be angry. It’s okay to be tired or hangry. But it’s not okay to hurt yourself or others because of those emotions. Then we find a solution. Usually, food because 90% of tantrums come from him being hangry. ” — Kaela Westbrook  5. “I let her be—I am showing her that I breathe very deeply and loud and she tries to imitate. Once she starts to calm down I speak to her with a very calm voice trying to explain to her that I acknowledge her feelings and the cause.” — Par Parpla  6. “Encourage him to use his words and name his feelings or help me understand what’s wrong. Sometimes, if it’s fueled by exhaustion/overstimulation, give him space and make the environment conducive for a nap or quiet time.” — Oriaku Onuoha Bean ', ' 7. “I have started to sit quietly and wait for him to calm a bit, and then we hug. Trying to comfort in the midst of it doesn’t work for us at all.” — Jennifer Navors  8. “Typically I just tell my kiddo “Okay, I can see that you’re upset. We can talk when you are calm.” And I walk away and let him get it all out. He usually calms down fairly quick (he’s 21 months old right now) and when he is calm we talk about whatever he is upset.” — Delaney Dishong  9. “Get on their level and talk through why it’s happening. Sometimes a redirection helps too.” — Shayna Rohrer Kerkstra ', ' 10. “My twin boys are three and what really works [is] that I sit close to them so they can reach me if they need me and start reading their favorite story. Usually 1-2 minutes later they stop crying and they are coming close for a cuddle and a story.

By          Deborah MacNamara          September 23, 2021 ', \" Toddlers and preschoolers crave connection, which is nature's way of keeping them close.  Accept the child's attachment hunger and provide for it generously when you can.  Don't battle their behavior nor increase separation through discipline.  Bridge the distance to reduce feelings of separation.  Play matchmaker and help the child accept their alternate caretakers.  Encourage and support tears of missing.  We’ve all been there. It’s bedtime and our littles begin stalling, “I need some water,” or, “one more story,” and sometimes, “I’m afraid,” occasionally accompanied by one big crocodile tear rolling down their precious cheek. From their lips to our hearts, these little pleas convey a much larger desire—to keep parents close, routinely disguised as a last-minute request, the last one being the most compelling in telling us why. \", ' Why is separation so difficult and why does it produce so much anxiety? Until approximately six years of age, young children are not fully developed as separate beings. They are highly dependent on others for caretaking, and staying close is one of the brain’s biggest preoccupations. In the 1950s, a British psychologist named John Bowlby coined the term attachment and said a child’s mental health was based on a satisfying and enjoyable relationship with a parent, that is both warm and continuous. Children aren’t meant to enjoy separation, it is nature’s design.  While there is nothing wrong with a young child who misses their parent, it can be unsettling to both parties.  Young children can be full of frustration, tantrums, resistance, and opposition in the face of separation. Alarm in a child often arises at nighttime, accumulated from the day and activated by the point of separation that sleep represents.  From a parent’s perspective, it can help to remember that if our children didn’t want us close, we wouldn’t be able to take care of them. Being attached is the superglue that binds us to each other and provides a sense of home, comfort, and belonging. Attachment is the doorway through which missing and separation anxiety enter.  Toddlers and preschoolers also come with shyness instincts that make them fickle when it comes to receiving care from others. This is the result of healthy brain development by six months of age, where a child zeros-in on one primary caretaker. At this time the child will begin to display stranger protest towards others and show a clear preference towards whom they want to be close. The instinct to shy away from strangers is nature’s way of ensuring they follow the people who are responsible for caring for them.  If children are meant to miss their parents and shy away from substitute caregivers, then how can we for care them given the separations that come with everyday life? ', ' Take time to collect their attention and engage with them fully. Relationships that are characterized by delight, enjoyment, and warmth tend to nourish their relational needs most of all. A deeper attachment with a child will help them grow as separate beings and allow them to face more separation. ', ' It’s important not to battle against a child’s behavior from pursuing their parent to the fears that appear at night—these are all just symptoms of the underlying separation problem. If forms of discipline are used that exacerbate the separation, such as time outs or consequences, then a child’s emotions will be more stirred up and their behavior more difficult to manage.  The focus needs to be on connection, on relationship, and on how we are holding on to them. ', ' A bridge is meant to connect two sides, despite the things that are too big to cross and in-between—like work, sleep, and school when it comes to our kids. Our focus needs to provide the antidote to separation, that is, connection.  We need to help our kids feel connected to us despite the impasse that is between us. Instead of focusing on the goodbye, we talk about the next hello, such as the plans for the following day or what you will do together when you are home from work.  At bedtime, you can focus on when you will come back and check on them, or how you will meet them in your dreams. In the day time, you can give the preschooler a picture of you to hold onto or connect with them over lunch. ', ' We can’t blame young children for preferring their parents but we can take comfort in knowing they can attach to other people too. Given their strong shyness instincts, it is important that we introduce them to the people we want to care for them.  We can’t leave these relationships up for grabs but must prime it by showing them we sanction the connection. This can include warmly introducing them to each other, pointing out similarities and common interests, and conveying that you like this person and trust them.  A child will follow those to whom they are attached, and if you demonstrate that you like the caretaker, they will follow suit with time and patience. ', ' Tears are part of the brain’s inner workings to release emotional energy when stirred up. Tears are not a problem, they are the answer when the missing is too much. What is important is to ensure a child has someone they feel comfortable with in sharing their upset, in crying or retreating to for comfort. When they can count on someone to help them emotionally, it will build trust and security with their caretaker and help them adapt to the separation from parents.  The late Maurice Sendak, author of Where the Wild Things Are, understood the problem of separation for the young child when he wrote, “And Max, the king of all wild things, was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all.”  Attachment is one of the most important forces in the universe that binds us to each other.  Our kids want to be with us, and we want to maintain their love. What we can do is put our energy into making it easier to be apart from us by focusing on connection.

By          Leslie Bruce          July 11, 2017  Toddler Tantrums are like earthquakes.  They can be short, localized and relatively painless, or they can be long, far-reaching and destructive. Toddler tantrums have no regard for the time of day or for your current location — they strike without warning and, often, without mercy. Nothing about a toddler tantrum is convenient and when you recognize one is upon you, you can’t be sure of its magnitude. Instead, you hold your breath, brace yourself and wonder if this particular tremor is going to be “The Big One.”  My 2 ½-year-old daughter is the kind of kid who melts down routinely for any variety or reasons, and often, for none whatsoever. It could be that she doesn’t want to brush her teeth, or because she isn’t allowed to throw chalk at the dog, or because she asked for a grilled cheese and I made her a grilled cheese.  At around 18 months, her tantrums started to take their toll on our home and my own sanity. I was walking on eggshells in my own house because I couldn’t handle another meltdown, and nothing I did would calm her down. I desperately needed to reclaim control of our home.  So I began educating myself on the topic — reading books and articles, researching methods and talking to people with backgrounds in early childhood development. And though there is no “foolproof” method to calming a tantrum because different children may require different things, most children in most situations aren’t inconsolable. With that in mind, I’ve compiled a list of calming techniques to help you navigate those tantrums whenever the ground starts shaking beneath your feet.  1. Keep your cool. Nothing else matters if you can’t manage your own reaction to your child’s tantrum. I have yet to meet the toddler who can find calm and clarity while being barked at by an adult. Admittedly, this is much easier said than done, and I lose my patience much more often than I like to admit, but it’s really important to hold it together. The more collected you are, the better shot you have at successfully managing the tantrum.  2. Diagnose the issue. More often than not, the cause of the meltdown isn’t because your child’s crayon broke or because a blueberry touched his or her plate. The tantrum is a symptom of a larger issue, which is usually something avoidable altogether…and, sorry to say, possibly the fault of the parents. For example, your child may erupt in a self-induced convulsion on the floor because he or she is overtired. If that’s the case, it’s on you, and you should make sure that he or she is well rested.  No matter how diligent you are with your child’s sleep, you will inevitably have an overtired child — whether from teething, jet lag or just a busy day. It’s helpful to keep in mind why he or she is acting this way, so you manage it better and don’t do something as psycho as implementing a blueberry ban in your home. (Guilty.)  3. Get on their level. Some tantrums are unavoidable. The first thing any parent or caregiver should do is get down on the same level as the child. After all, no one wants to feel talked down to, figuratively or literally. Toddlers, too, are actual humans, and regardless of how irrational they’re being, whatever they’re feeling is real. Standing over them and wagging your finger won’t help. Instead, meet them on the same plane and make eye contact.  4. Take deep breaths. This applies to you and your child. It’s easy to lose your cool, but when your child is absolutely hysterical, nothing you say is going to have any impact, even if you say it really, really loud.  5. Narrate the situation. This sounds mind-numbing, but I assure you it works (and not just with toddlers, it’s an effective means of navigating a conflict with children, tweens, teenagers and husbands as well). Tantrums often arise from a frustration that your child cannot explain with words.  If your child trips and falls down, your immediate reaction might be to tell them that they’re ok. But they might not be — they might be frightened or scraped up. Narrate the situation and ask them how they feel: “You tripped and fell on the ground, and it looks like you hit your knee and that scared you. How do you feel now? You look upset.” My hysterical daughter will usually shove her knee to my face as a way to say “please kiss it,” and then shut off the water works and go back to whatever she was doing beforehand.  6. Offer them a hug. This isn’t the easiest thing to do as a parent. When your crazy-eyed child just flung a plastic truck at your face in a nonsensical rage, giving them a tender embrace may not be your first instinct. But it can work. Just the other day, my daughter was freaking out over having to get ready for bed. As home girl started to pull back her arm to hit me, I knelt down in front of her and offered her a hug.Instantly, she melted into my arms for a huge embrace. She had feelings bigger than what her little body could handle and needed me to understand her — and a hug helped.  7. Discover the art of distraction. This technique works particularly well for children between 12 and 24 months. Unfortunately, the older they get, the quicker they start to catch on, so use it while you can.  8. Give them options. All people want to be in control of their world, and toddlers are no different. They are told what to wear, what to eat, where to play, when to sleep…it’s endless. So it’s only natural they want to exert some control over their little world. My daughter has recently decided that sunblock is the devil, so rubbing it on her face has been a battle every morning. I simply tell her that we have to wear sunblock to keep us safe, but she can choose which sunblock we use or if mommy or daddy puts it on her. I don’t overwhelm her with options, just two. For my child it’s more important to have a say than it is to keep up the fight. The end result is still what I need it to be, but if she can help guide us there, it’s usually a smoother journey.  9. Find a calming tool. My daughter’s blankets are usually a quick way to get her to calm herself down. As soon as she has them in her hands, she puts her thumb in her mouth and searches for a shoulder to cuddle into. We also employ a good amount of Daniel Tiger. While I try not to park my child in front of the TV, certain shows have value in helping kids understand their feelings, and Daniel Tiger is like a baby Buddhist. Every day, my daughter sings a Daniel Tiger jingle when she finds herself in a like-situation to something she saw.  10. Let them meltdown. Sometimes, regardless of what you do, a tantrum is just going to happen, in which case, it’s best to just let them ride the wave. Put them down in a place where they can’t hurt themselves and walk away. Without an audience to “perform” for, some kids will pop right up off the floor and move on. Others just need time to process their feelings. e We can all benefit from a good cry every now and then.

By          Alexis Barad-Cutler          August 24, 2018  If you’re a parent of a toddler who goes to preschool, you’ve probably listened to the agonized wails of said child as you left them for the first time (or 20, or 40) in the classroom. Perhaps you’ve built up quite the strategies for making your exit with the least amount of tears (for both of you). But for all those cries and acting like you were going off to war, you would think that school pickup would grant you something of a hero’s welcome from your toddler. Well, not so, apparently. Because there’s a whole other thing you didn’t account for: The Toddler Witching Hour.  Pickup is also the time when toddlers are overtired, hungry, and just about ready to lose their little minds. And guess what? That’s the precise moment when they’re offloaded to you, their parent, and most likely when you need them to move along and get them home. So how do you prepare for your toddler’s worst and try to squelch a meltdown before it begins? It helps if you’ve done some advanced planning.  Here are 8 tips for taming a toddler tantrum during school pickup. \", ' Kids love snacks. They just do. And they’ll do almost anything for snacks. And no, we’re not talking about those chickpea crisps you’ve been trying to pass off as “chips.” Do yourself a favor and come with a snack your kid actually likes. Only allow them to have the snack if they listen to you and get in the stroller or car to go home. ', ' If you know that you absolutely must get home and you can’t get your toddler to go down the preschool stairs at anything more than a glacial pace, quickly look your kid’s favorite friend to have a play date with. It’s not ideal because you won’t get a nap in immediately, but you will get yourself and your toddler down those school steps, and to your next destination. So what if the thought of hanging out with their playmate’s mom makes you want to start drinking at noon? Isn’t that what mimosas are for? ', ' One of the best ways to avoid having your toddler go boneless and refuse to move an inch from that spot on the sidewalk where you told them that you would not be going to a store to buy a toy today, is to have a routine. A routine that your child can depend on each day, letting them know exactly what to expect after pickup. ', ' It helps to have little landmarks that you both look for every day and that might be fun to look forward to passing on the way home. You can work the landmarks into your routine. For example: you arrive at school, you get the lunch box and the sippy cup, you wave at the security guard, get into the stroller, and then stop for a moment at the little fountain where all the kids throw pennies, before strolling on towards home. Giving your toddler something that’s special between the two of you, on the walk home, is a great way to fight the terrible tantrums. ', ' Transitions aren’t easy for kids in general, but they are especially hard for the toddler set. It can help a great deal to not rush out of preschool, and instead leave time to make a slow exit. Many preschools have a waiting area for parents and caregivers where you can read a book, color, or play with a favorite toy. ', ' It’s not the cleanest of strategies, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. Think of it as a negotiating tactic: “I’ll get you a special cookie from the bakery, and then we’ll head on over to [insert wherever you need to take your toddler.]” ', ' Sometimes a tantrum is unavoidable, and all you can do is put on your game face and pretend that this is all a bad dream. Toddlers are especially skilled at being noncompliant creatures, no matter what appealing options you’ve thrown their way. The Walk of Shame home with a screaming toddler is just about the most awful thing you can endure as a parent, but know that it happens to everyone. One day, that college girl with her earbuds on who stopped to give you a look of horror on the street when she saw you go by will understand exactly what it was like to be you. ', ' If you’re going through a particularly sticky time with your little one, you might want to consider bringing a friend (of yours), relative or babysitter with you to help you handle your toddler. Someone new and refreshing that they don’t see at pickup often – like Grandma — could help flip the switch. Sometimes it helps to just have another person next to you as you’re pushing your stroller down the street with a screaming toddler in it, because then it signals to the rest of the world that you are a fine human being who others like to be around, and not a monster.

That seems a little dramatic, I know, but hand to the sky, I did.  I couldn’t understand how my child was able to turn the bedtime process into an hour or two, and on really exasperating nights, three hours of crying, melting, and doing everything but going to sleep.  One more book, mama.  One more sip of water, mama.  One more snuggle, mama.  Related: Sleep like a baby: Your expert guide to 12 months of rest  Meeting all needs and fulfilling all requests still wasn’t enough to get my child to close his eyes. I started to wonder: Am I being too permissive? Do I need to do some reward charts? Would it help to give a consequence? Maybe if I give a lecture my son will drown me out and fall asleep from boredom. I felt nearly desperate to try anything that would give us more peace and better sleep.  But I felt stuck. None of those solutions seemed like true solutions. Were my only choices to battle my child or force him to surrender by way of tricks and gimmicks? ', ' I decided to head back to the drawing board. Parenting is a relationship, so I took time to evaluate not only my goals but my child’s.  What is my goal?  Well, I wanted my son to get to sleep so that I could have a few moments of the day to myself. Maybe that 30 minutes would allow me to get some much-needed house chores done. There is no better feeling than knocking something off the ol’ incessant “to-do” list. Or maybe I could do something small for myself like catching up on “This Is Us” (I’m only three seasons behind) or taking a shower (I haven’t washed my hair in four days) before collapsing in bed. Was that too much to ask? Just 30 minutes to myself in a 24-hour day?  Related: Survey says moms only get 30 minutes per day to themselves  I found myself totally dug in, entirely focused on his bedroom door, knowing that on the other side was my freedom. And every time my son opened his eyes to ask for something or wanted to get up or fussed when I left, I felt my freedom slipping away.  What is my son’s goal?  My son’s goal was for me to stay, and developmentally, it makes sense. Children are wired to be in close proximity to their caregivers. This is how they’re designed to ensure survival. While I view bedtime as an opportunity to have some alone time, my son’s system associates bedtime with his primary attachment leaving him to do something else. He doesn’t care if it’s to do laundry or veg out. His nervous system just registers my intent to leave as a threat and so he will pull out all of the tricks to get me to stay. One more book. One more sip of water. One more snuggle. He will cry, power struggle and mimic my shadow as I leave.  Now, I know what you may be thinking, because I have thought it too. My child is manipulating me. They are being defiant. I must get this behavior to stop. The truth is, in order for your child to manipulate you, they must have executive functioning, which is an advanced function of the prefrontal cortex, a brain region highly immature at the ages of two, three, four, five…up to the age of around 25. ', ' I have realized that when I am more invested in the outcome of something than my son, I become frustrated. The more frustrated I become, the more my son clings to me. The more he clings to me, the more focused I become on my goal. And the more he senses my desire to leave, the more he bids for me to stay. Round and round we go.  To break the cycle, I knew I had to reclaim my power, not take his.  This required me to understand my circle of control.  I was completely invested in commanding my son which, of course, led to my frustration because I was attempting to control that which was not mine to control. His thoughts, feelings, words, and actions are his. I can influence them, not control them.  Related: I don’t have the ‘perfect’ bedtime for my kid  Any time we attempt to take on someone else’s experiences as our own, we generally will find ourselves in a state of frustration and resentment. Control moves you away from connection, and based on my son’s bedtime goal, it was the one thing he actually wanted.  I realized that my son wasn’t making me upset. That wasn’t in his circle of control. How I felt and responded was my responsibility. So, I focused on the power of my words, thoughts, feelings, and actions. I found myself shifting from, “How can I get my son to __” to “What action can I take here?”  This allowed me to:  Reframe my perception of my child’s willful defiance as his need for close proximity  Readjust my expectations for my child  Release goals I have set for my son like falling asleep by a certain time  Set goals for myself about how I will respond when the bedtime blues begin  There is much peace that comes from accepting what is happening. We can’t control it, but we can reflect and adjust our reactions to it. ', ' With both of our goals in mind, and focusing on those things within my circle of control, I was able to implement some tools for our bedtime experience. My new goal became us winning, not just me. ', ' Our boundaries are not about what our kids can’t do but what we will do. This moves us from control to connection. Ask yourself: What are you willing to do?  Are you willing to lay with your child until they fall asleep?  Are you willing to lay with your child for five minutes?  Are you willing to sit outside the door?  Are you willing to postpone the “to-do” list in the name of this parenting season?  Are you willing to alternate bedtime routines with your partner to give yourself some freedom?  Are you willing to hire a babysitter one night a week so you can have some “you” time?  I often find myself telling my child, “I am willing to lay here while you close your eyes” instead of “Close your eyes or I am leaving.” See the difference there? One is an effective boundary, and one is focused on control.  Regardless, find what you are willing to do—instead of telling your child what you are not willing to do— communicate it, and then hold yourself accountable for following through with those boundaries. ', ' Consistent routines help children feel safe and connected because their brain knows what to expect, and can better process the sequence of events from a less primitive place. Involve your child in deciding what your bedtime ritual may look like. For example, perhaps every night at seven, you get into jammies, brush teeth, share about your day, read a book and then hop into bed.  To make this ritual more concrete for your young learner, use something like a visual aid or encourage them to set a timer to move from one activity to the next. Announcing transitions is also useful in helping your child shift. Something like, “Do your one last thing, and then we are going to put on our jammies.” Or “When we put on our jammies, we will read a book.” Or “It is time for a book. Which will you choose?” ', ' My son loves when I get creative for bedtime. Sometimes it is something as simple as doing a few yoga moves as we wind down or sitting in bed for a round of finger breathing.  I like to up the connection with something silly, too. For example, if your child likes lots of snuggles, snuggle her with the deepest, most loving snuggles, pretending that you can’t get enough of them. Or switch up the roles, asking your kiddo for some. “Oh, please give me one more hug. I love them so much!” Cling to your child as they have often done to you!  Additionally, focus on activities with desired results. Invite your child to close their eyes while you rub their back, do a body scan or another easy meditation strategy, or tell them a story. These connection-based activities help your child relax and it primes their brain for bed. They become intrinsically motivated to close their eyes and still their bodies because they want what comes next. I find this is much more effective than power struggles and it helps my child fall asleep much more timely. ', ' If you find that you are unwilling to lay with your child until they fall asleep, focus on the next connection moment. This is an attachment-based strategy developed by Dr. Gordon Neufeld, which reduces a child’s anxiety and resistance and respects their developmental and emotional ability to separate.  The premise is that by focusing on reconnecting, rather than your leaving, you help your child relax and fall asleep on their own as they begin to trust that you will return before they need you again. As a result, they feel less of a need to chase your attachment.  Tell your child you are going to step out of the room and describe to your child what you will say when you come back.  “I am going to come back, and when I do, I will tuck you in again.”  “I am going to come back in two minutes. I will give you another hug when I return.”  Leave for as short of an interval as needed (like 30 seconds), then a whole minute. The goal is to return before your child worries and build from there. You may find that in time you are able to say something like, “I will see you in the morning. I am so excited for our morning snuggles.”  Related: To the mama who stays up (way) past her bedtime ', ' Another simple tool is to give a token of yourself to your child that they can sleep with. This may include a picture of the two of you, one of your t-shirts, or something else that you and your child decide on together. This helps your child feel closer to you even when you are not in the room. ', ' This is a preventative tool to be done outside of the moment of dysregulation, outside of bedtime. Role play: You be your child. Encourage your child to be you. Then switch where you play yourselves.  Role play how it has been going. Bring in the silly and play and even practice the meltdown. Then, role play again with what you want the bedtime ritual to look like moving forward.

By          Jessica D'Argenio Waller, MS, CNS, LDN          July 19, 2022  4 PM Productions/Shutterstock \", ' Why sleep is so important  Focus on bedtime consistency  Start now for long-term sleep success  Summer brings inevitable inconsistency in bedtime routines, but new research shows that once school starts, maximizing your preschooler’s sleep can make a big difference in how well they transition to kindergarten—and their subsequent school performance.  In a study published in The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)’s journal “Pediatrics,” researchers tracked the sleep patterns of 221 soon-to-be kindergartners with an eye toward how much sleep they got in a 24-hour period, and whether that sleep was consolidated overnight or combined from naps and nighttime sleep.  They found that the kids who consistently slept for at least 10 hours at night—not including naps—were better able to adjust to kindergarten, and their teachers reported they had better socio-emotional, learning engagement and academic outcomes than those kids who had more irregular sleep patterns.  Related: Our son thanked us for ‘redshirting’ him in kindergarten  In the study, the teachers were blind to how much sleep each child was getting, and the researchers controlled for income-to-poverty threshold ratios, child health status and number of missed school days.  “The transition to kindergarten requires new social, emotional, and cognitive competencies, significant expansion of children’s social networks, and formal instruction and evaluation never experienced before,” write the study authors. They noticed that while factors like children’s health and their socioeconomic status have been examined in terms of kindergarten transition success, sleep duration has not. ', ' As a society, we tend to overlook the value of sleep—but according to sleep expert and neuroscientist Dr. Matthew Walker, it’s incredibly important for brain health. “Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day,” he writes in his book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams. “When sleep is abundant, minds flourish. When it is deficient, they don’t.”  In kids, sleep can improve focus and concentration, as well as memory, mood, immune function, school performance and behavior, notes AAP.  Related: California becomes first state to delay school start times—here’s why that matters  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and National Sleep Foundation recommend 5-year-olds get 10 to 13 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period, but the Pediatrics study shows that at least 10 hours of consolidated nighttime sleep seems to be the magic number in terms of kindergarten success. ', ' The more regularly a child slept for at least 10 hours at night, the better the child was able to adjust to kindergarten, note the authors. Their kindergarten success was even more pronounced if the 10 hours of nightly sleep was established before kindergarten began, when the child was still in preschool.  “The more consistently children got 10+ hours of sleep during the night, the better the children’s peer relationships, relationships with their teachers, overall academic performance, and sight recognition of words and letters,” says lead study author Douglas Teti, distinguished professor and head of the department of human development and family studies at The Pennsylvania State University,  to CNN.  Related: Why I got strict about a 7 p.m. bedtime for my kids ', ' You may want to start sooner than later if your little one is starting kindergarten in the fall, given that it was long-term sleep habits that seemed to make the most impact.  “The intervention should begin before kindergarten begins in September,” Teti says. “Parents should do what they can to help their children get most if not all of their sleep on a regular basis during the children’s nighttime sleep period.”  That may mean cutting back on naps to help consolidate your child’s sleep at night. Naps may still be developmentally appropriate for your kiddo, but if it means their bedtime is pushed back till later, it could be worth omitting the nap. If you have questions or concerns, your child’s pediatrician is a good resource. ', ' For early school-age kids, the authors recommend bedtime before 9 p.m., which would make wake-up time around 7 a.m., for a full 10 hours of nighttime sleep. Naps should count as extra, not toward that 10-hour goal.  Kids should avoid all screens like TVs, tablets and phones at least 30 minutes before bedtime.  Parents and caregivers should be involved in their child’s bedtime routines, keeping them as consistent as possible night after night. That may look like a bath after dinner, followed by books before tucking in.  Because parents’ and kids’ sleep schedules tend to be closely aligned, parental sleep habits are also important to monitor, note the authors. That may mean starting a more consistent bedtime routine for yourself, too.  “Good sleep hygiene [e.g., organized bedtime routines, limited screen access, and bedtimes before 9 p.m.] may be as critical for the well-being of children as it is for adults,” note the authors.

By          Christine Organ          May 27, 2022  @Lazy_Bear/Twenty20  I didn’t realize how strange this was until I was recently talking with some friends. Most mothers I know, at some point, have slept with their children. I seem to be in the minority of moms because I never had my kids sleep in my bed.  When my oldest son was born, he slept in a crib or pack-n-play from day one. Same with my youngest son. When they were toddlers and awoke in the middle of the night (which, admittedly, was rare), I hugged them and tucked them back into their own beds.  Related: We need to stop shaming moms for co-sleeping—and research shows why  For some families, co-sleeping is the only way for anyone to get any sleep. And for many parents, co-sleeping is an enjoyable bonding experience. Not for me. And part of my motherhood journey has meant honoring my own boundaries—one of which is nighttime is for me.  Not everyone shares this disdain for co-sleeping—my husband included. In fact, when our kids were younger, anytime I went out of town, he and our kids would have a slumber party in our bedroom. They’d sleep cuddled up in our queen bed, arms intertwined and snoring away. When my husband went out of town, however, I fiercely protected my bed.  Some might call this selfish; I call it setting healthy boundaries for myself. I knew that I needed sleep to be an engaged mother the next day. I knew that I needed those precious few hours of “alone time” to recharge. And in those early days of motherhood when I was constantly touched out, I needed the physical space.  Just because we are mothers doesn’t mean we can’t have boundaries, especially when those boundaries help us be the good moms that we want to be, the good moms that we know we are.  Quite simply, setting this motherhood boundary made me a better mom.  I didn’t really think much of it, but over time, I’ve realized just how strange it is that I have never co-slept with my kids. When I heard about moms who loved snuggling up with their toddlers, I wondered if something was wrong with me. When I read about the benefits of laying down with our kids until they fall asleep, I worried that I wasn’t being a “good mom” because I set this limit.  Whatever your boundary is, accept it. Acknowledge it. Stop apologizing for it.  Over time, I’ve realized that this was just that pesky mom guilt sneaking in again. Oh, how mom guilt loves to make us fret, doesn’t it? With time and age—not to mention the fact that my kids are incredible sleepers—I stopped fretting and worrying. Just because we are mothers doesn’t mean we can’t have boundaries, especially when those boundaries help us be the good moms that we want to be, the good moms that we know we are.  It was never really about sleeping with my kids; it was about boundaries and telling that pesky mom guilt to take a hike. Because it will always be something, right?  Whatever your boundary is, accept it. Acknowledge it. Stop apologizing for it.  Maybe you love snuggling up with your child at night. If so, go for it. Maybe you have an early bedtime or you have a playdate limit or you say “no” to weekend activities so you can decompress with your family. Whatever your boundaries are, respect them. Own them. Be empowered by them, not ashamed of them. Because you are doing what it takes to be the best mom you can be.  Related: Why I Share a Bed With My Baby  So whatever your mom boundary is, shed the mom guilt about it. We are mothers, not martyrs. And we should feel empowered by, not guilty about, setting boundaries that help us be the best mothers we can be. When we set these boundaries, we aren’t just taking care of ourselves, we are teaching our children valuable lessons about boundaries, body autonomy and healthy relationships.  We are showing them that their wants don’t take precedence over others’ needs. And we are showing them that it is possible to love them with all of our hearts while also respecting ourselves. And in doing so, we are showing them how to love and respect themselves too.

By          Anne-Marie Gambelin          July 16, 2021 ', ' So how do I promote good sleep hygiene in kids?  Is it bedtime yet? Whether the day was calm or busy, a lot of mental and physical energy goes into being and raising a kid. Some days fly by, while others never seem to end. Either way, when the evening rolls around everyone is ready to call it a night with early bedtimes to get the rest they need to thrive tomorrow.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children up to age 5 need between 10 and 14 hours of sleep per day, including naps. But families have to take steps to ensure littles are getting those quality hours in.  An early bedtime is a solid step towards getting enough sleep, but it doesn’t stop there. Studies have shown that good sleep hygiene, including establishing a regular relaxing bedtime routine ensures quality rest. ', ' Getting your kids to go to bed, stay in bed, and fall asleep quickly is the holy grail of the 7 o’clock hour. But, it’s not always easy.  These healthy sleep practices have been empirically linked to better quality and more adequate sleep, improved sleep regulation (the transition between sleep and wakefulness), and shorter sleep onset latencies (the amount of time it takes to fall asleep after the lights have been turned off):  Maintain a regular sleep schedule (even on weekends)  Establish a consistent bedtime routine  Have an early bedtime  Avoid having electronics in the room while falling asleep  Refrain from caffeine before bed (like soda)  Studies have found that when parents are unaware of how these practices influence their children’s sleep, irritability, inattention and misbehavior can follow. It can also lead to the deterioration of mama’s mood.  In a pilot study published in the Journal of Family Psychology, researchers found that the quality of children’s sleep significantly predicted the quality of mama’s sleep, which was found to be a significant predictor of maternal mood, stress and fatigue.  Bottom line: Good sleep hygiene, particularly an earlier bedtime, can improve the quality of life for both kids and moms.

By          Heather Marcoux          August 19, 2019 ', ' For a lot of families, summer is a season where rules relax and bedtimes get pushed back a little later than usual. But with school starting, weekday mornings are about to start a lot earlier for many kids, and parents might be wondering how to reset the clock on bedtimes.  According to Terry Cralle, an RN, certified clinical sleep expert and the spokesperson for the Better Sleep Council, a new school year is a good opportunity for families to get a fresh start on sleep routines.  “We have to start with really making sufficient sleep a family priority [and] having some discussions about the importance of sleep with our children,” Cralle tells Motherly. “It shouldn’t be at bedtime when everyone’s cranky and tired. It should be during the day that families really discuss the importance of sleep for all family members.”  If you need to have a conversation about getting enough sleep for school, try the following tips from Cralle. ', ' Make sure that younger children, especially, understand that sleep is a positive, not negative thing, and don’t use the threat of bedtime as punishment.  “What we want to do is, ideally, change how children perceive sleep because children can see sleep as a great big timeout where they’re missing out on things,” Cralle explains, suggesting that parents instead try to present sleep and bedtime routines as “with positivity and as just a non-negotiable part of our lives.”  Cralle wants parents to make sure they’re talking with their kids about how a lack of sleep can impact one’s mood, health and academic ability. Just as we teach our kids about the importance of eating healthy, we should be teaching them about the importance of sleeping healthy, and from an early age. ', ' According to Cralle, it’s really important to empower children with choices around bedtime, because the one thing they can’t have a choice in is the fact that they do need to go to sleep.  “They’re going be more accountable, more responsible, and hopefully, develop good sleep habits and practice good hygiene early in life,” if we empower them through simple choices, Cralle suggests.  “So we can say, what pajamas do you want to wear to bed tonight? What book do you want to read? Let them participate. If they can pick out their color of their pillowcase, let them do it. Whatever’s age appropriate.” ', ' Instead of just telling kids when they need to go to bed, involve them in figuring out an appropriate bedtime.  The American Academy of Sleep Medicine  lists how much sleep kids need depending on their age. Have them look up how much sleep a kid their age needs, and then show them the National Sleep Foundation’s  online bedtime calculator.  Kids can choose how many hours of sleep they need and when they want to wake up, and it will show them when they need to go to bed.  It’s not an arbitrary decision mom and dad made, it’s science and math, and you can’t argue with that. ', ' Cralle says adding one sleep-related item to the back to school shopping list can really help children understand the importance of sleep as they head back into the classroom. A conversation about how getting a good night’s sleep is important for school success, combined with a shopping trip for a new pillowcase or comforter can really help children see sleep as an important priority, and give them something to look forward to using at bedtime. ', ' When our kids are infants we’re really good at setting up rooms that can help them sleep. But as our children age out of cribs and start to accumulate a lot of possessions and playthings, their rooms can become a less ideal sleeping environment.  According to Cralle, it’s not uncommon for kids to get up after bedtime and start playing with toys in their room. She recommends removing stimulating toys or storing them in another area of the home, and never putting televisions, tablets or smartphones in a child’s room. ', ' At least an hour before bedtime, screen time should come to an end and other, more relaxing activities can begin. Cralle says families can designate a certain hour as   DEAR (Drop Everything and Read) time   , or move from away from brightly lit screens and towards a board games or puzzles, “things to do to get that blue light out of their eyes.”  A family-wide media curfew can be a good thing, says Cralle, as it helps parents “walk the walk” when it comes to sleep hygiene. “Don’t be looking at your iPad and tell your child to put it away,” she explains. ', ' https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0pkkWjeKL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link  According to Cralle, age 3 is the ideal time to start reinforcing the importance of sleep for a child’s health, but older kids and even mom and dad can reverse bad bedtime habits if the whole family buys in. That may mean curtailing your kids’ (and your own) caffeine consumption, says Cralle.  “We’re seeing younger and younger age groups of school children walking around with their Starbucks cups, with coffee, late in the afternoon,” says Cralle, who thinks a lot of parents just don’t have good information on how caffeine consumption can impact sleep—for our kids and ourselves.  She recommends limiting the number of caffeinated beverages available in the house if you’ve got tweens and teens at home, and watching your own consumption as well.  “We have to say ‘Here’s how we’re  all  going to approach it.’ It’s sort of like seat belts with children, we never would buckle them in and get into the car, and not do it ourselves.”  This may be the season to tweak your own sleep habits mama.

(Our                                          Parent’s Support Facebook Group                                          is a great place to find a listener if you are already familiar with Hand in Hand’s tools and your                     children are 12 or under).  “You can get ‘mad’ at your child,” in this space, says Kristen. “You don’t want them to hear it.                     You don’t want them to be a part of the listening partnership, but you can say in that listening                     partnership, ‘Go to sleep!’ she says.  Use the time to say what you’d like to say, to think about how you feel about sleep, to cry or rant                     and rave.  “It doesn’t reflect who you are as a person, it’s more about the feelings you have and the energy                     behind them,” Kristen says. “Those feelings are there when we are with our children, they are                     behind all the things we say to our children and how we show up, and so when we can work on all                     those feelings we can show up in a different space, and we can set limits in a different way, we                     can set limits with support rather than setting limits with anger.”  There’s a huge difference there in how children experience and how they can move through what’s                     hard for them, she says. “When we show up with frustration and anger or tiredness, they come back                     with more of that challenging behavior. It’s more of a power struggle. When we show up in warmth                     they can butt up against it, but then they soften.” ', ' Once you have made space for your own feelings, you are ready to move onto actively helping your                     child. A good first move is play.  “Play and laughter are incredibly powerful for loosening up tense feelings, for a child and a                     parent. We call it                                          playlistening                                          and with this tool you want to create laughter and follow it,” Kristen says. Start when things are                     calm – rather than when you want them to go to sleep.  Get the giggles going by giving a child the more powerful role in play. ', ' “A simple playlistening idea around naps or sleep could be as easy as you laying on the floor,                     saying, “I’m just want to go to sleep, I hope nobody wakes me up,” Kristen says.  “This prompt, of course, acts as an immediate invitation to a child to wake you up!”  In this role reversal, it’s you trying to go to sleep and the child is going to stop you. To keep                     the laughter going, you try again.  “Try saying, ‘Oh! I’m so tired, I hope nobody wakes me up.’ The child sits or jumps on you and                     wakes you up, and you roll around, hugging and laughing.  In the midst of this physical play, you collapse, and snore, and be asleep again, inviting more                     laughter. Customise games to suit what appeals to your own child’s sense of humor and makes them                     laugh, and let him keep coming and keep waking you up.  Play as long as there is laughter. This play can be great for breaking up the tension that both of                     you have about naps and falling asleep.” ', ' Sleep is                                          similar to separation anxiety                                          . “If you think about it, sleep is a time when a child is moving into their own space all by                     themselves even if we are there, even if we are nearby and that can be scary. Especially at night,                     that’s the longest time they are separated from us,” Kristen says.  Doing                                          Special Time                                          has a similar effect as it does with separation anxiety—it fills up a child’s “connection                     cup,” so that they can have an easier time going from a more aroused state to a more relaxed state.  “Special time can be very useful. Have it on a regular basis. Have it on the calendar, so they know                     it’s coming. Do what you can handle – if it’s once a week, that’s ok. There’s no judgment.                     Ask what you can reasonably do that makes sense for you and your family, where you can have one on                     one time with your child,” says Kristen. ', ' Lastly, Staylisten. When it comes to sleep, staylisten because you want the child to feel that pain                     they have about going to sleep at the same time they are getting support from you. (If you are new                     to Staylistening, read these posts first:                                          The Science Behind the Hand in Hand Parenting Tool of Staylistening                                          and                                          What to Say During Staylistening                                          )  To set it up you would say to a child that it’s naptime: “It’s time for a nap, sweetheart.”  “With a warm voice, tell your child what is going to happen. Expect a child to have a fairly big                     reaction, because obviously there is resistance there. Stay with the limit,” says Kristen.  “A child might say, “No! It’s still light out, I’m not, I won’t.”  “Continue to stay warm. Stay right where you are, in the room you want sleep to happen, and make                     sure the child stays. Keep your child with you. Be persistent with the limit.  “It’s light, but that doesn’t matter to the sun. It’s still naptime.”  “You don’t have to engage in a conversation about the sun, or about it being light because that                     isn’t relevant. A child picks something like that as a pretext to stay stuck where they are. Focus                     on the limit, and stay warm,” Kristen says.  “It’s a good thing if your child starts to cry. You let them cry about the limit so that they can                     get your attention and support about the pain they have about sleep. That support helps them heal                     that fear they have around going to sleep.”  Although the limit stays the same whether it is night or day, it might be easier to set during the                     day, Kristen advises.  By using these tools in tandem, you work on your feelings and you work with your child’s feelings                     in partnership, moving together to work through a resistance to naps.

I'll check on you in 10 minutes.  By          Rachel Gorton          February 22, 2018 \", \" Here are 10 phrases you can use to help keep kids in bed if you're currently fighting this battle:  Trying to get your child to go to sleep is a challenge that most parents face at some point. Whether you’re putting your little one down for a nap or starting the bedtime process, it can sometimes feel like a battle you aren’t going to win. And even if you do, there’s the staying in bed part that can be even more difficult.  It is very common, especially in toddlerhood, for kids to get out of their bed the moment you leave the room—making the bedtime process feel impossible.  After the 64th time of walking your child back to her bed, you might be wondering how you’ll possibly survive this stage, and what it’s going to take for her to stay put.  As a mom who recently went through this with our school-aged child, I completely understand how taxing and frustrating the whole process can be. Thankfully, being a sleep coach came in handy in our situation, and we were able to use several key phrases that made a huge difference. \", ' 1. “I’ll check on you in 10 minutes.”  Rather than waiting for your child to get up and come find you, assure her that you will return in five or 10 minutes to check in. This will help give her a sense of security that you will come back and teach her that it’s okay to want you, but that it is still expected she stays in her bed.  2. “It’s time to sleep now in your bed. I’m going to sleep in my bed too.”  This doesn’t mean you also need to go to bed right away, but assuring your child that you too will be sleeping in your own bed, helps make that connection that beds are for sleep.  3. “You can have one pass tonight if you need one. After that, I won’t be responding to requests unless it is an emergency.”  We all know this trick. Children are put to bed and then suddenly want a glass of milk, another bedtime story, and a pony. While it is important to make sure your child is safe, responding to every single request can draw out the bedtime process. If you allow your child one or two “asks,” then it can help him to think a bit more about how often to call out to you.  4. “If you don’t get your sleep tonight, we might not be able to do X activity tomorrow since we will just be too tired.”  This isn’t meant as a threat or punishment, but as a reminder that lack of sleep directly correlates with lack of energy. There are negative effects associated with not sleeping enough, and often our children don’t realize this unless we explain it in a tangible way.  5. “If you stay in your bed tonight, we can do an extra activity tomorrow.”  This is not to be used as a bribe or to entice your child to sleep better by rewarding them with treats or other objects. Rather, it emphasizes the direct connection with “more sleep = more energy”—when children have something to look forward to they might take it a bit more seriously.  6. “Can we make it your job to stay in bed tonight and can we count on you to do that?”  Often when we give our kids responsibility it gives them a sense of ownership. Even if it is something as simple as staying in bed, providing them with a “job” to do, can help it feel less scary or overwhelming. You can also ask your child to put his stuffed animals or loveys to bed and have him tell them the same thing.  7. “I know you can do this and I’m here for you.”  Despite our frustrations that our children aren’t going to sleep, it is so important that we provide encouragement as much as possible. Our children count on us to be steady and calm and when we model that behavior along with words of affirmation, our children have a much better chance of feeling safe to fall and stay asleep.  8. “What do you need in order to feel safe?”  It is very common for children to have separation anxiety and fear around sleeping alone and it is important to create an opportunity to address those fears. Talking about them and asking the appropriate questions will help your child work through any feelings of fear or anxiety.  9. “If you’re feeling scared it is okay to come get one of us.”  School-aged children often have real feelings of fear and night terrors, and when you give them the option of seeking comfort from a parent, it can help them feel relief. I have seen the use of this phrase actually minimize the amount of middle of the night wakings because the child feels less anxious knowing they have our support.  10. “Once the light turns green or the timer goes off, you can go ahead and get out of bed.”  The Ok to Wake! clocks or kid-friendly alarms, are a great way to encourage your child to stay in bed until the clock says it’s time. These are typically best to use for the morning hours, but you can also set them for the 10-15 minutes check-ins after going down at bedtime.  There are a few other important factors to consider when using these phrases:  Try not to use punishment or lose your temper during the process.  Keep dialogue short when responding to call-outs and questions after bedtime.  Remember that behavior at bedtime is usually a continuation of how your child behaves throughout the day (e.g., if your child can’t be alone during the day, that isn’t going to change at night).  These phrases can be helpful when managing a child who has a hard time staying in bed, but ultimately taking a look at  why  the behavior is happening in the first place is important to address the problem at its root.  Your child looks to you for guidance and support in all other areas of life and bedtime isn’t any different. By responding positively, while still implementing firm boundaries, you are helping to establish security and connection—and eventually a better sleeper.

By          Rachel Gorton          September 25, 2017  Whether you’re an adult tossing and turning over thoughts of tomorrow’s responsibilities or a baby who sleeps best with a full tummy and swaddle, we always sleep best when we feel content and safe. As parents, that’s why we have to be mindful of how that sense of security affects our children’s bedtimes as they grow.  Allow me to walk you back a bit: I used to look forward to bedtime. Like really, really look forward to it. As many of us mamas know, there is often very little rest to be had during our children’s waking hours—which has led even me, a certified sleep specialist, to sacrifice a solid night of rest to catch up on an episode or two of some trash TV.  For a long time, I could get away with this because I knew the night would likely be uninterrupted once I went to bed. That’s because for much of the past seven years of my son’s life, he’s been a great sleeper.  Bedtime in our household was nearly a perfect string of events. The routine from bath time to lights out usually took 30 minutes, followed by my son being fast asleep within three minutes of me leaving the room.  I am well aware this is not the norm for most families and that we were pretty lucky. But, as they say, good things don’t last forever—even for sleep consultants.  Suddenly, our formerly independent sleeper doesn’t want to be in his room alone. No matter how many times we check under the bed, in the closets or in the drawers, he simply cannot fall asleep or stay asleep on his own.  If I’m being really honest, I totally forgot how real sleep deprivation is.  I have begged and pleaded with my child to go to sleep. I’ve continued to assure him that he’s fine and needs to sleep. I’ve even teetered on the edge of discipline, which is a big no-no in the sleep world.  Since nothing seemed to make a difference, I basically had two choices: I could let go of the expectation that my son should be a completely independent sleeper. Or I could continue to allow myself to feel frustrated that he wasn’t responding the way I wanted.  With a whole lot of resistance, I chose the first option and I’m so glad I did.  My husband and I decided to come up with a plan that provided our son with the security he was looking for, making our primary goal to get him the rest he needed.  We communicated this plan to him: We would sit outside his door until he fell asleep and then keep a matress underneath our bed for him to pull out if he woke up in the middle of the night. The one rule was that he did so quietly, so that we could continue to get our sleep. He looked so relieved.  Since implementing this plan, I had to sacrifice my “alone” time in order to sit outside his door—sometimes for up to an hour.  I had to put my very strong feelings of frustration aside and continue to remind myself to practice compassion and patience.  I had to spend a lot more time connecting at bedtime instead of rushing the process so I could get on with my own plans for the evening.  It has been hard. It’s also reminded me of the crucial role I play in my son’s life, not just at bedtime but as the person who gives him confidence throughout life.  I am his constant. I am the person he looks to when he is scared. My child simply feels safe with me. So for now, I can give him the peace of mind that all is well, that he can relax, that he can breathe deeply and go to sleep.  The small sacrifice I made by giving up my evenings alone allows him to get the sleep he needs to thrive the next day.  Yes, I miss what it used to be, but I am embracing what it is now. We are doing what we need to do and all is going to be okay—and you’ll be okay, too, mama.

By          Deborah MacNamara          June 28, 2017  At the age of 4, my daughter looked at me and said, “Mama, we have a problem–I don’t like to sleep.” Shocked, I managed to stifle my horror and mutter, “Well that’s unfortunate because I do.” In fact, I never appreciated sleep until I had children and got so little of it.  As my daughter and I faced off across the bedtime divide we couldn’t have been at more opposite ends of the spectrum. She wanted to hold onto me and I wanted her to let me go. It was only when I realized we could both get what we wanted that I was able to find my way through. First, I had to surrender to the idea that she was going to be the one to change.  I realized it was me that needed to lead us through the sleep impasse—but couldn’t do so without first understanding what was going on for her.  What alarms a child most of all is separation from their caretakers. The reason separation is so hard is because attachment is their greatest need. Children weren’t meant to take care of themselves and seek to be strongly tethered to adults who assume responsibility for them. As immature beings, children are highly dependent upon their caretakers to meet their hunger for contact and closeness, safety and nourishment. When they are apart from us, their alarm system can be highly activated leading to clinging, protest and crying in distress. The alarm can appear more subtly like needing to go to the bathroom, get a glass of water, more food or have help in fluffing their pillow up!  The biggest separation a child faces in the day is bedtime–not school or even when we are at work. We think because we are all in the same house they feel connected but sleep represents a long separation–up to 10 hours of unconsciousness where they can feel very far away from us. When you drop them off at preschool or daycare there is at least an adult to greet and take care of them. When they go to bed there is no one waiting saying, “Hello, welcome to your sleepy dream time! I will make sure the monsters don’t bother you tonight.” What children face when we put them to bed is the biggest disconnect of their entire day. It seems like such a cruel irony that when children need us the most, we typically have little energy left.  The idea of being generous and giving, things that come so easy on a full parenting gas tank, can reduce us to tears.  A post shared by Motherly (@mother.ly) on Jun 21, 2017 at 6:41am PDT  When I started to listen to what my daughter’s behavior was telling me, I realized she was scared and lonely. It was actually a compliment to our relationship that she depended on me to keep her safe and wanted to be close. When I asked her why she didn’t like to sleep she told me, “Because the monsters come out of my eyes.” She then pointed to the ceiling and said, “That dream catcher is broken.” She was telling me she needed more from me and to take the lead in helping her rest. I told her that monsters weren’t her problem nor broken dream catchers, I was there to care for her throughout the night. Before you start to panic, I didn’t give up sleep, but I did certainly made it appear to her that I did.  I started by finding the generosity in me that she needed and accepted some things would need to wait–like housework or emails. I found my tears about the ‘me-time’ I craved and surrendered to the sacrifices that come with being a parent. I worked hard at not rushing her, having warmth and delight as I put her to bed, sending her a genuine message that I loved being with her. When the desperation would sneak in on me again I would remind myself that I could sleep all I wanted when she eventually left home or when I was dead.  Instead of expecting her to say goodnight and “see you in the morning,” I moved to make our separations shorter. I told her I would check on her in five minutes and that she could listen for my footsteps in the kitchen or for the sound of my voice. I always returned as I had promised full of more kisses while reminding her of the plans for the following day. I would tie invisible strings between our beds and tell her she just had to tug on them if she needed me. I told her I visited her in the night and watched her sleep. I once kissed her cheek with lipstick when she was sleeping but she told me in the morning, “I don’t like it when you make my face all messy!”  I even experimented with putting things under her pillow to find in the morning like treasure. She enjoyed the picture books most of all, running to read them together in our cuddle time. However, she was not happy with me when I left a pair of her favorite princess underwear under her pillow to wear. I tried many things–some worked and some did not, but the message slowly got through.  I worked hard to build a bridge from bedtime to the morning, conveying I was holding onto her so that she could let go of me.  Instead of saying goodnight I tried to point her face into the next hello. I aimed to sooth her alarm system that had become activated by separation. I created pit stops for her to anticipate, breaking the 10 hours of separate space into bite size pieces she could manage. We both started to sleep better as a result.  As I took the lead in navigating us through the bedtime separation my daughter grew more confident that this was my job and not her duty. While singing her to sleep one night she looked at me and said, “Mama, no offense, but I can’t sleep when you are singing to me. Can you go now?” I stifled my laughter and said, “I’m sorry honey, have I been keeping you awake all this time?” ', ' Contact Us  Advertise with Us  Share Your Story  Become a Motherly Instructor  Motherly Gives Back ', ' Our Story  Diversity Commitment  Careers At Motherly  Partner with Us  Press  MotherlyInsights  Privacy & Security  Accessibility  Terms of Sale  About Our Ads  Do Not Sell My Information  Motherly 2023 ®  ', \" How to build choice into your child's routine, without sacrificing on your time.  By          Dr. Allie Ticktin          March 8, 2019  One of the best ways to empower children is by providing them with the ability to feel in control. That sense of control leads to fewer tantrums, more confidence, a sense of responsibility, problem-solving skills and it cultivates a sense of value. But it can be difficult to provide your child with choices all of the time, and parents often don’t know where to start, especially when schedules are crazy. \", ' Too many choices can be overwhelming for a little one so keeping choices small is key. Asking, “Would you like an apple or banana?” or “Do you want to put your shirt or pants on first?” can provide choices without taking too much time.  Two is typically the optimal number of choices for most kids. When we start to give kids more than two choices, we lose structure and kids become overwhelmed. Minimal choices provide children with a sense of control without bombarding their decision-making skills. ', ' Schedule in choices throughout your routine to create a consistent sense of control for everyone. For example, the evenings can be the time to let your little one decide what vegetable they will eat for dinner, or every Sunday you can allow your child to choose between two restaurants for dinner. It is important that, even if routine changes, you acknowledge the change and, ideally, let your child choose whether to be a part of the change. ', ' This or that choices are easy to build into almost any time of the day or situation. If your child is having trouble getting in the car, allow them the choice to sit behind the driver or passenger seat. If they can’t decide on what shoes to wear and you need to get out the door, offer a blue sneaker or a red sneaker. Simple choices are an easy way to empower a child and avoid a potential tantrum. ', ' Sometimes your child is going to want to change their mind, but it is important to stick to their original choice. Being consistent with choices teaches responsibility, builds problem-solving skills and reinforces your child’s value in the family. When you begin allowing kids to change the choices they make, it can break the structure and lose the benefits of offering them that power. ', ' Acknowledge that you recognize what a good choice your child made and how much you appreciate her helping to solve a problem. This will help to build your child’s confidence and make her feel confident to make more difficult decisions in the future. ', ' This might be one of the most important things to remember. If you are not okay with an option, do not present it to your child. Following through on your child’s decision is the key to success.  For example, when making your daily schedule, you can allow your child to choose between nearby playgrounds, but don’t mention an option you want to avoid, such as a playground that is too far out.  There are many ways to empower your little one and giving a few small choices throughout the day is just one simple way to help raise strong, confident and capable little humans and avoid tantrums.

Start by being a detective and think about whether your son\\'s life has changed significantly recently. Was a new sibling born? Did you move to a new house? Has there been any parental conflict? Was there a car accident? Any major change could have triggered separation anxiety. Even a particularly bad dream can linger and cause anxiety.  Watch your son for clues, and work to decrease any source of stress. Meanwhile, have him draw or act out his feelings; children often turn their feelings into art since they have difficulty talking about them. See if you can find any clues there, and certainly give him lots of reassurance. Avoid telling him to \"toughen up,\" as it will only make it harder for him; let him feel your protection and encourage any of his efforts at being brave. If he is anxious for more than a few weeks, it might be time to seek out a child psychologist or other trained and licensed expert who works with young children.

In order to calculate what a ‘normal’ attention span is for a child, take your child’s age and multiply by 4 minutes. A 4 year old child’s attention span can last for as long as 16 minutes. This will vary depending on the interest level of the task or activity. The higher the preference for the activity or task (e.g., video game, coloring ,etc), the longer the time your child can remain focused, and the lower the interest in the activity, the shorter the time that your child will remain focused.  The other area to assess is level of activity – would you describe your child as hyperactive or impulsive? You can determine this by thinking about how your child responds to a new environment. For example, when your child is at a friend’s house for a play date, does she touch everything and move from one object or toy to the next, spending very little time with each toy or game? If so, continue to make your observations and talk to our pediatrician. Your child may have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder but this is diagnosed by the age of 5 and the inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity would need to be observed across multiple environments, such as home and school.  It seems that you are describing a 4 year old child who may be interested in the environment and wants to make sure she has the chance to experience it all. Posing for a picture is boring and looking directly at an object for any longer than a few seconds is too time consuming for someone who has too much to do! It sounds like your daughter is an energetic and curious 4 year old – enjoy her!

It takes hand-eye coordination and fine motor control to manipulate the blocks correctly, along with an understanding of cause and effect. Set aside an area in which she can practice building. Also stock your house with shape sorters, nesting cups, and peg puzzles, which help develop many of the same skills. ', ' When your child strings even two words together, he’s trying to engage you in a conversation. The more you talk to him, the larger his vocabulary will be, so try to expand on his thoughts. If he says, “Mommy shirt,” respond, “Yes, this is Mommy’s shirt. It’s red and has a stain on it, doesn’t it?” When you read a book together, point to the words as you say them, use sound effects to enhance his interest in the story, and ask questions about what you’ve read after you finish (even if he can’t answer them). ', ' Using utensils at every meal helps your child practice an important skill and fosters independence. Although it’s messier than when you feed her, giving her a spoon or a fork helps her grasp the significance of mealtime and encourages her to imitate what the big people at the table do. You can also have her try to put on her shoes and unzip her coat by herself.

This shows that he’s planning and stretching his imagination. Instead of letting him play alone with Play-Doh or crayons, you should sometimes join in on the fun. Ask him, “What are you making?” or “May I color with you?” ', ' Completing a two-part task (like when you ask her to pick up a toy and put it in the bin) means that your child’s listening skills and memory have advanced by leaps and bounds.

The songs are consistent and predictable, but spontaneous language is not. When your son wants to eat or wants a toy, how does he let you know? Does he point? Does he grunt? In order to communicate with your son, continue to use language, point to objects and name them, and encourage him to repeat a word or phrase after you. If he gestures that he wants milk, ask, \"Do you want milk? Say, ‘Milk, please.’\" When he uses these words, give him milk right away. Continue to work on this repetition (e.g. \"This is a ball. Can you say ball?\").  When toilet training him, you don\\'t need him to do a ton of talking. Explain what you are doing, put him in Pull-Ups or underwear, and take him to the bathroom every 30 minutes. When he has success going potty, offer him a small reward such as an M&M or cut-up pieces of a gummy worm. Do not punish him if he has an accident. Instead, remain neutral and say, \"You can try again next time.\"  It’s possible your son\\'s lack of response may stem from difficulty hearing certain levels of sound and his delayed response may be a result of slowed processing. Consult your pediatrician and request a hearing test and a central auditory processing evaluation. Another source of information and support is Early Intervention. Ask for a developmental evaluation to determine if your son is behind in any of his areas of development, such as speech. This may qualify him for in-home services.

It’s important to consider your family history. If you haven’t already, share your concerns with the pediatrician to monitor your child’s language development over time.  In the meantime, encourage as much language as possible at home. Don’t respond immediately when your son points or grunts. If he is pointing to the milk, for example, ask, “Do you want milk?” If he nods, say, “Yes, milk, Mommy” and pause. If he doesn’t repeat your phrase, say, “Now you try. Yes, milk, Mommy” and wait. If he starts by saying only one word, reward his effort by giving him the milk. If he starts crying or screaming, wait patiently and don’t say anything. When he is done crying or screaming, calmly say, “Yes, milk, Mommy” and wait for him to repeat. In essence, you will respond to requests when he uses words. He will resist your efforts initially, but be consistent from hour to hour and day to day.  When you are taking a walk, point to all the different objects, animals, etc., that you see and identify them out loud. Ask him to repeat the words. Say, “I see a squirrel. Do you see the squirrel?” Wait for him to respond. Also, read picture books with him and identify different illustrated objects. Ask him, “Where is the butterfly?” After he points to it, say, “Butterfly. Can you say butterfly?” and wait for him to repeat.  You can also maintain a journal. You can chart his progress by writing the words, dates, and strategies you used to gain an understanding of how to continue helping him. And encourage all family members to use the same strategies. You can also contact your town or county’s Early Intervention Services to request a speech evaluation. Your child may be eligible for speech services to help with his language development.

', ' Does your toddler start swinging their fists at the first sign of frustration? Here\\'s how to handle a little slugger.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Few things can make you second guess your parenting skills more than seeing your toddler hit another kid. But while this behavior may be mortifying, it doesn\\'t mean your child will grow up to be a bully.  \"I call toddlerhood the \\'hitting stage\\' of development because this behavior can be common in children between 1 and 2 years old,\" says Deborah Glasser, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in Richmond, Virginia, and former chair of the National Parenting Education Network.  Here are some of the reasons that your toddler act aggressively, along with tips from our experts on how to stop the hitting. ', \" Toddlers may not realize that hitting can hurt, and that's probably in part because of the fact that they don't fully develop a sense of compassion until about age 3. Even if your child grasps the idea, they may not be able to restrain themselves when they're around other kids. They may not fully understand their own emotions, let alone another person's, so it's unlikely that they are acting with the intent of deliberately upsetting someone.  Their reasons for hitting are innocent enough—and usually fall into one of the following categories. \", ' Like everyone else, toddlers get bored, hungry, tired, and overwhelmed. The difference is they lack the verbal skills to identify and communicate these emotions, which can make them even more frustrated.  \"Since your toddler\\'s vocabulary isn\\'t fully developed yet, they\\'re more likely to use their body to show their feelings or to strike back in disagreement,\" says Miriam Schechter, M.D., an associate professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, New York. ', ' You\\'ve probably noticed that your little one hits more often when they\\'re on the playground or at a playdate. This may be because they are around other children who grab their toys, push them down, or simply invade their space—and who might not hear your kid yelling, \"Stop!\" or \"Mine!\" The anger or disappointment your child feels is hard for them to rein in. ', ' When your toddler has an off day, they may simply lash out because they\\'re cranky and don\\'t have many coping skills. \"Even kids who don\\'t hit or bite often can lose control when they\\'re stressed, or at the end of a long day,\" says Dr. Schechter. ', ' Your child may have seen an older sibling play-fighting with a pal and want to do it, too. \"For some children, there\\'s a trial-and-error factor,\" says Jennifer Shu, M.D., a pediatrician in Atlanta. \"They see another person hitting and think, \\'Hmm, let\\'s see how that feels.\\'\" ', ' Some children are just born with a personality that\\'s less easygoing, and they like to lead with their fists or teeth. \"A lot comes down to temperament,\" explains child psychiatrist Stanley Turecki, M.D., author of The Difficult Child. Some kids easily shake things off, while others go into street-fighter mode. ', ' Toddlers constantly ask themselves, \"If I do this, what will happen?\" That carries over into their dealings with others, says Theodore Dix, Ph.D., associate professor emeritus of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. \"They don\\'t have the skills to get what they want in a reasonable way, so they may act pushy or overly defiant,\" he explains. ', ' Toddlers may not have a good grasp of spatial relations. If they are feeling cornered by other kids in a small area, they may try to hit (or claw or bite) their way out. ', ' When your child lashes out physically, address the behavior right away. Get down on their level, look them in the eye, and say in a calm, firm voice, \"It\\'s OK to be mad/frustrated/upset; it\\'s not OK to hit.\" That\\'s all you need: Validate the emotion (it\\'s OK to feel their feelings) and hold the boundary (but it\\'s not OK to express their feelings through aggressive behavior).  Lengthier explanations are often lost on toddlers and may backfire because they may learn to equate being aggressive with getting attention. If they hit again, remove them from the situation. You can even hold their hands and say, \"I will not let you hit.\"  \"When you discipline your kid every time [they hit, they\\'ll] learn that there\\'s no excuse for violence,\" says Dr. Schechter.  Here are some other ways to handle a hitting episode. ', ' Try to figure out what has upset your toddler enough to make them hit. Are they annoyed they can\\'t find a favorite toy? Bothered by someone in their space? Do they need a snack? Give them the words to articulate what they\\'re feeling. If they slap a sippy cup of water off the table because they secretly want milk, help them convey that. You might say, \"You want milk! Say, \\'milk.\\'\" ', \" Take note of which situations lead your child to hit others, and try to preempt them. Do they strike when they're tired or hungry, when they're feeling crowded, or when they have to leave a friend's house? These are common triggers for kids, says Elena Labrada, M.D., a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Menlo Park, California.  Sidestep them with a little pre-planning: Make sure your toddler takes regular naps, keep snacks at the ready, and prepare them for transitions. Get creative when you plan ahead, too: If they lash out because they always want their playmate's favorite toy, for example, ask if they can put the toy in question away before the next playdate. \", ' Some kids believe that any attention beats no attention at all. If you freak out when your child does something wrong, they may be intrigued and feel motivated to act up to get a reaction. ', ' When your child feels anger or frustration, label these emotions for them. Say, \"You look like you\\'re mad that Sam took the yellow bus,\" or \"Are you upset that I won\\'t let you climb onto the coffee table?\" Employing positive reinforcement (praising your child when they share a toy, or use a gentle touch) inspires better behavior. ', ' Toddlers have a limited understanding of how their behavior affects others. Your child needs to understand how their friend felt when they got hit. Say, \"That hurt Sam and made him feel bad.\" Tell them you know that they are having a hard time, but hitting someone is never the right thing to do. ', ' Use imaginary play to help your child learn to resolve sticky situations. Pretend you are a toddler who has taken their favorite toy and teach your child what to say in response (\"That\\'s my toy—please give it back\"). If that doesn\\'t work, tell your little one to ask an adult for help. Act out these scenes often enough that the lessons sink in. ', ' Ease the tension between children by introducing another toy or game. \"Distracting kids with a new activity is often the easiest way to diffuse a dispute,\" says Erin Floyd, Ph.D., a clinical child psychologist in Lilburn, Georgia.  If they\\'re fighting over a toy, give them a minute to see if they can resolve the conflict first. If it starts to escalate into hitting, say, \"If you can\\'t take turns, I will put the toy away and we can try again later.\" Don\\'t let your child keep a plaything that they\\'ve snatched aggressively. By making them give it back, you\\'re letting them know that being rough won\\'t get them what they want. ', \" It's important to be aware of everything your child watches—even cartoons—to make sure their shows don't contain violence. Researchers have found that children who are exposed to violent images in the media are more likely to be aggressive themselves. \", ' Experts say that spanking is never appropriate, but especially not for a 1-year-old. \"At this age, your child is developmentally unable to connect you hitting [them]—however gently—with anything that [they] may have done,\" says Dr. Turecki.  If you\\'re tempted to meet your toddler\\'s aggressive behavior with spanking, consider how confusing it is to be told that hitting isn\\'t OK and then get hit as punishment. ', ' While it can be worrying when your toddler hits someone else, try to remember that there\\'s no malicious intent behind it. Your little one means well—they just need to learn better ways to express their feelings, which will happen in time. \"Toddlers go through these stages for a month or two,\" explains Dr. Turecki. \"Anything that is short-lived is usually nothing to worry about.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.  ', ' While the \\'terrible twos\\' can be tough, we caught up with some experts to help us understand how to get through this phase with patience, understanding, and grace.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Erin Drago / Stocksy  If you are the parent of a little one, you probably are feeling some trepidation about your child entering the toddler years—specifically the phase known as the\\xa0\"terrible twos.\"\\xa0The terrible twos is a term used to describe the challenges that come with raising a 2-year-old.  But although the name makes this phase sound, well… terrible, not every moment of parenting a 2-year-old is dreadful. In fact, 2-year-olds are inquisitive, imaginative, adorable little creatures. Moreover, having the right attitude—and a few tricks up your sleeve—can make the hard parts much easier to navigate.  We caught up with some experts in the field to help us understand the terrible twos better and to offer some tips for getting through this phase with grace, know-how, and a healthy perspective. ', ' \"The \\'terrible twos\\' is a term used to describe the sometimes challenging behaviors of kids around the age of 2,\" says Ali Alhassani, MD, pediatrician and head of clinical at\\xa0Summer Health. Interestingly, according to Dr. Alhassani, the term \"terrible twos\" has been used since the 1950s or so. It generally describes a toddler who says \"no\" frequently, tends to challenge authority (i.e., their parents), and has frequent mood swings, he says.  Oh, and don\\'t forget about tantrums. Kids in the throes of the terrible twos tend to throw tantrums \"at the drop of the hat,\" Dr. Alhassani describes. Still, he assures, however loud and disruptive 2-year-old behavior can sometimes be, parents should be aware that this is a developmentally normal phase.  \"Parents may be annoyed to hear this, but this is normal, healthy behavior for a child whose brain is rapidly developing,\" explains Dr. Alhassani. \"They are learning to express their desires but still lack the ability to have patience and emotional regulation.\" He also notes there is a wide range of normal when it comes to the terrible twos. While some toddlers are quite challenging at this age, others are more easy going and calm. ', ' The terrible twos tend to hit hardest around the age of 2, but there are no hard and fast rules. Some children are early bloomers while others come into their fussy, obstinate phase a little later. \"While there are some early birds who may begin to demonstrate terrible two behaviors prior to 2 years (18 months+), most children begin to exhibit increased emotional instability, outbursts, and oppositionality between the ages of 2 and 3 years,\" says Jennifer Weber, PsyD, director of PM Behavioral Health for\\xa0PM Pediatric Care.  Of note, Dr. Weber says that it\\'s also common for kids to develop terrible two behavior after they turn 3. This can be an unwelcome surprise to parents who thought they were well and done with this phase! \"When it manifests a bit later, it is often due to the demands of toileting, preschool/daycare, and social constraints they are struggling to adjust to,\" Dr. Weber explains. ', ' So how do you know your child has entered the dreaded terrible twos? One classic sign is that your toddler will frequently refuse to do things you ask them to do, says Dr. Alhassani \"Your toddler will frequently say \\'no\\' to things like getting dressed, eating, and going to sleep (often called a sleep regression),\" he describes.  Your child will also begin to throw tantrums over seemingly small grievances, Dr. Alhassani says. Furthermore, you might notice your child deliberately not following their normal routine as well as exhibiting troubling behaviors such as biting, throwing objects, and destroying toys, Dr. Weber explains. ', \" It's normal to feel distressed about your toddlers' new and sometimes explosive behaviors, but there is hope. Here are some expert tips for getting through this challenging stage. \", \" Having realistic expectations about what the 2-year-olds are like and what you should expect of them in terms of behavior can go a long way. Just because your child now knows how to walk, talk, and feed themselves doesn't mean they are ready for high-level instructions, says Dr. Alhassani. So cut your toddler (and yourself) some slack. \", \" Dr. Weber suggests having a clear plan to reward positive behavior and also plans for how to address any off-task behavior. Every parent is different, but this may involve removing your child from situations that are unsafe or disruptive and/or implementing time-outs. Rewarding positive behavior may include praising your child consistently when they behave well. All of this will teach your child which behaviors are acceptable and which aren't. This also gives your kiddo plenty of opportunities to learn to emotionally regulate. \", ' It can be super helpful to pre-empt any negative behaviors, says Brianna Leonhard, founder of\\xa0Third Row Adventures, certified teacher, and board certified behavior analyst (BCBA). \"Parents can help manage terrible twos by setting up routines in advance before tantrums begin,\" she says. Again, this may involve consistent responses to unwanted behaviors and consistent positive affirmations for good behavior. Additionally, creating predictable, persistent routines around daily activities and naps/sleep can reduce anxiety and decrease tantrums, says Leonhard. ', ' Leonhard is a fan of giving your child choices whenever possible. \"Parents can provide two choices to toddlers to give them a sense of authority while still maintaining parental control,\" she says. For example, during snack time, you can offer your child a banana or an apple, both healthy choices. \"The toddler is given a choice and can take ownership in their snack, but the choices presented are both acceptable options for the parent,\" she describes. ', ' Dr. Weber says that, young as they may be, even 2-year-olds can learn calming techniques to deal with \"big\" feelings. Start early by helping kids develop skills like deep breathing and finding their \"calm body,\" Dr. Weber describes. You can teach these skills when your child is not in tantrum mode so that, when they are, they will be able to draw on those skills and use them.  For example, if your child is beginning to become dysregulated, you might be able to remind them that they are not having a calm body, which should remind them to use previously learned techniques for calming down. According to Weber, you can say something like, \"Honey, your body is not calm. You are crying so hard. We are going to step into the other room and I am going to wait for you to have a calm body before we continue playing.\" Praise any attempts your child makes to calm themselves. With time, they will get better at doing so. ', ' While most \"terrible two\" behavior is normal, and something your child will outgrow, there are some behaviors that warrant a bit of outside help. \"If you feel your child\\'s behavior is escalating to include potentially dangerous behaviors, such as head-banging, hurting siblings, or property destruction, it is essential to loop in your child\\'s pediatrician,\" says Dr. Weber.  Your pediatrician can help you understand if this behavior is normal, or whether a referral to a child therapist, neurologist, developmental pediatrician, or other behavior specialists is needed. Whatever the case, remember that you are not alone. Raising 2-year-olds is hard. But like everything else parenting-related, this too shall pass.

', ' Whining can be challenging behavior, but knowing how to handle it can help turn the situation around.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Almost from the time my daughter Elizabeth could speak in sentences, she whined when she didn\\'t get what she wanted: my attention, a snack, a repair job on a faulty toy. When she turned 3—and suddenly seemed like such a \"big girl\"—her continued whining started to drive me crazy. I\\'d mutter angrily under my breath, clench my teeth, and even whine back. Once I even lost control and yelled so vehemently that she burst into tears. But more often than not, I\\'d let her have her way just to make the shrill sound stop.  Like nails on a chalkboard, whining—an irritating blend of talking and crying—has the ability to make almost any parent get angry or give in. And preschoolers are pretty smart. They know that pleading in that pitch has a strong effect on their parents, and if the behavior has helped them get what they wanted in the past, they\\'re more likely to try to repeat it in the future. ', \" While whining can seem like manipulation, it may be helpful to instead consider why kids whine. A whiny child isn't being annoying or acting spoiled deliberately. Whining is often the default way that young kids can express themselves when they're tired, cranky, hungry, uncomfortable, or just don't want to do something.  Although 3- and 4-year-olds' language skills are rapidly improving, they still don't have the vocabulary to describe all of these feelings, explains Michele Borba, Ed.D., author of Parents Do Make a Difference. \", ' Even when your child is able to articulate that they are hungry for lunch or hate sitting in the car seat, for example, they may still whine because they have learned from experience that whining means you\\'ll pay attention. \"For 3- and 4-year-olds who are testing the limits of their independence, whining makes them feel very powerful,\" says psychologist Carolyn Crowder, Ph.D., co-author of Whining: 3 Steps to Stopping It Before the Tears and Tantrums Start.  \"If you can\\'t stand whining, your child will do it even more, simply because it gets a reaction,\" agrees Jane Nelsen, Ed.D., co-author of Positive Discipline for Preschoolers. Even scolding your child can reinforce the behavior. \"Kids just want a response. When they don\\'t know how to get a positive response, they\\'ll go for a negative one,\" Nelsen explains. And needless to say, giving in (\"OK, you can have one piece of candy, but promise you\\'ll eat your lunch?\") doesn\\'t work either. You might get a respite from the whining, but you\\'ll perpetuate the problem. ', ' Fortunately, you can break this pattern—in a way that encourages your child\\'s development rather than punishes them. \"When you stop getting frustrated by the whining, your child will stop too,\" insists Nelsen. At first, this laissez-faire approach seemed completely unrealistic to me. But because my daughter was a whine connoisseur, I decided to try it.  It wasn\\'t easy—often I was tempted to yell or just give her what she wanted—but I was determined to be firm and consistent. \"You have to exercise a lot of self-control,\" acknowledges Dr. Crowder. But remember: You\\'re asking your child to do the same.  To my amazement, within a few weeks, Elizabeth had gotten into the habit of asking nicely instead of nagging. To help turn your whining experiences around in a similar way, here are four strategies you can try next time the whine comes to town. ', ' Pick a calm, quiet time to tell your child that there\\'s a new rule: If they whine, you won\\'t respond. \"From then on, whenever he whines, keep your facial expression absolutely neutral,\" Borba says. Calmly remind them that you\\'re there to listen and help when they use their regular voice. You might also ask them to choose a signal for you to use as a warning sign when they\\'re getting into whining territory, such as pulling on your ear, suggests Nelsen. ', ' It might be hard to believe, but your child may not even realize that they are whining—or they may not truly understand what whining is. The best way to explain it is to record both whiny and regular voices and then play them back. (Make it clear that you\\'re using the tape to help your child learn, not to make them feel bad.)  You may also have to teach your child the specific words to use when they want to tell you how they are feeling, such as being tired, hungry, bored, or frustrated. \"Kids really want to do what\\'s right,\" Borba says. \"But too often, we mistakenly assume that they know what\\'s right. When you show them, they have a model to copy.\" ', ' There\\'s no reason to wait for the whining to come up; certain situations can be anticipated and avoided. Look for patterns and factors that lead to whining, then discuss them in advance. If your child tends to whine at the store, for example, give them a gentle reminder before going that whining isn\\'t acceptable. To reinforce the point, ask your child to repeat the reminder by saying, \"What is our rule for the store today?\" ', ' \"Parents always point out, \\'That\\'s not a nice voice\\' but often don\\'t provide enough positive reinforcement,\" says Borba. You might say, \"Thanks for using your normal voice\" or \"My ears love that voice.\"  This approach worked wonders for my daughter. Whenever she asked for something politely, I acknowledged it and thanked her. At first, I felt awkward being so effusive, but her whining decreased dramatically. ', ' \"Many parents say, \\'I tried it yesterday and it didn\\'t help,\\' \" Borba says. \"But think of changing one of your own habits: It won\\'t happen overnight.\" You need to be consistent and stick with it over time. If you don\\'t, your child will realize that you\\'ll eventually give into their whining. I noticed a change in Elizabeth within a month. Some kids may take more time, others less.  So keep at it. If you don\\'t help your child practice effective methods of communication, the whining may get worse and affect future relationships. More important than how others perceive the whining is how continuing the behavior might prevent your child from learning other, more useful strategies for communication. \"Keep in mind that your goal is to help your child be the best they can be—and the time that it takes will be well worth it,\" Borba advises.

Close your eyes and count to ten or take a few deep breaths. If you have the option, hand the child-care (and cleanup) duties to your partner or another trusted adult while you take a breather.  What\\'s your discipline style? Find out! ', ' Now that your toddler can walk and climb, it\\'s time for another round of safety steps. \"Get down on your hands and knees so you view your home from your child\\'s perspective,\" suggests Kurt Klinepeter, M.D., associate professor of behavioral and developmental pediatrics at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Check that the electrical outlets are covered and cabinets that contain poisons are locked up. Get lid locks for your toilets, keep oven doors closed, and avoid stocking the lower shelves of your fridge with liquids and breakable containers. Hide potential scribbling devices (pens, pencils, crayons, lipstick). Also take extra precautions with electronics. Make sure your TV is anchored, get a shield for the Blu-ray player, and store remotes out of sight. Don\\'t leave your cell-phone charger dangling. Your toddler is likely to pull on it, sending your phone crashing to the floor. Worse, he might put an unconnected cable into his mouth or wrap it around his neck. Finally, store jewelry and cherished, breakable items out of reach until your child is older. ', ' Make your toddler\\'s short attention span work in your favor. If she\\'s pulling all the pillows and cushions off the couch, say \"No\" in a calm but firm voice. Briefly explain why she shouldn\\'t do it (\"We need those so everyone can sit\"). Then divert her attention by taking out a favorite toy or book or by playing some music. Within moments your child will likely be engaged in the new activity. If she starts heading back to the couch, simply sidetrack her with something else. ', ' Go ahead and green-light messy or aggressive activities when you can. \"These satisfy a toddler\\'s curiosity, give him practice using his fine motor skills, and help him learn about cause and effect,\" points out Richard So, M.D., a pediatrician at the Cleveland Clinic Children\\'s. If your kid has a habit of ripping up books, give him a stack of old newspapers to shred. Encourage him to play with blocks so he can build and knock them down to his heart\\'s content. Set up a fun art project that won\\'t necessitate a big cleanup. Spread a huge sheet of drawing paper on the floor, sit him in the middle, and let him create a masterpiece with crayons or finger-paints. Or take him outside and supervise as he plays at a sand or water table (if you don\\'t have one, use his old baby bathtub and toss in some plastic bowls and beach toys). Set limits for messy play: \"It\\'s okay to play with these papers, but not the ones on Daddy\\'s desk.\" Always supervise your child closely, since it will take time for him to pick up on the boundaries you\\'ve set.

', ' Share  Tweet  Pin  Email ', ' A: Dear i_m_huges:  Your son has begun to tell you \"NO!\" because he has discovered that he is a separate person from you, with his own feelings and wishes which are sometimes in conflict with your feelings and wishes. Congratulations! He has taken a big step along the long road of becoming an independent, self-reliant individual. When he says, \"NO!\" he is asserting his own healthy individuality. You do not need to make him stop saying \"NO!\" to everything--after all, it doesn\\'t really matter what he says; the point is that he is feeling disrupted and annoyed and your goal is for him to feel less disrupted and annoyed. The parent\\'s aim is to control the overall situation from the outset, so that a power struggle is avoided. Therefore, you will find it easier to get along with him if you try to side-step direct battles as much as possible by thinking ahead and smoothing things over so that he doesn\\'t get upset from the beginning.  For example, when it is time to change his diaper, you can manage the situation so that you aren\\'t directly interrupting him when he is in the midst of something he considers very important. Perhaps you can bring the diaper to him and change it while he plays, rather than calling him away and interfering with his interests. Little children are easily distracted from one thing to another. You can use this tendency to guide him, in a friendly way, towards the dinner table or out the door or whatever it is that he needs to be doing. Give him a few moments of preparation by telling him, \"We are going to stop in five minutes and put our coats on,\" so that he is not suddenly surprised by these events. Of course, it takes a bit more time to prepare a toddler for these inevitable interruptions and transitions--but it will help him if you give him this extra time and attention during this phase.  Toddlers are often touchy about everything and difficult to get along with. They have a need to feel in control and in charge and the boss of every little thing. But this normal behavior is usually less trouble if the parent can make the effort to be especially diplomatic and respectful of the toddler\\'s need to feel in control. Toddlers feel pushed around by the same requests that they used to follow gladly when they were younger--the parent often experiences sudden panic when this happens, as if the child who used to be cooperative has overnight become a grouchy opponent. But you can help your son gradually outgrow the \"NO!\" stage by keeping your cool and side-stepping a direct battle of wills whenever you can.

', ' Temper tantrums can make you question your parenting skills, but they’re actually a normal part of toddlerhood. Here\\'s why they happen and how to handle them—without losing your mind.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  When your kid\\'s in the middle of a tantrum, it can be tough to keep from having an outburst of your own. \"Meltdowns are terrible, nasty things, but they\\'re a fact of childhood,\" says Ray Levy, Ph.D., a Dallas-based clinical psychologist and co-author of Try and Make Me! Simple Strategies That Turn Off the Tantrums and Create Cooperation. \"Young kids—namely those between the ages of 1 and 4—haven\\'t developed good coping skills yet. They tend to just lose it instead.\"  If your toddler has been experiencing temper tantrums, it\\'s important to get to the root of what\\'s really happening—and as much as possible, to keep your own emotions in check. Keep reading to learn the best tips for dealing with toddler temper tantrums and why they happen. ', ' According to Dr. Levy, at its core, every tantrum results from one simple thing: not getting what they want. \"For children between 1 and 2, tantrums often stem from trying to communicate a need—more milk, a diaper change, that toy over there—but not having language skills to do it,\" says Dr. Levy. \"They get frustrated when you don\\'t respond to what they\\'re \\'saying.\\'\"For older toddlers, temper tantrums are more of a power struggle. \"By the time kids are 3 or 4, they have grown more autonomous,\" Dr. Levy continues. \"They\\'re keenly aware of their needs and desires—and want to assert them more.\"  By the time your child reaches preschool, they can use their words to tell you what they need, but that doesn\\'t mean their tantrums are over. They are still learning how to handle their emotions, and a minor disagreement can escalate quickly. Because your child values their growing independence, they may feel especially frustrated when they need help. Some lose it when they try to do something challenging, like tying their shoes, and realize they can\\'t do it alone.  It helps to remember that tantrums are not a sign of bad parenting In fact, they\\'re an essential developmental stage for kids. \"Tantrums help kids learn to deal with their negative emotions,\" says clinical psychologist Linda Rubinowitz, Ph.D., a marriage and family therapist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Illinois. \"Sometimes children get so overwhelmed by their new independence that they get overstimulated and melt down.\" When they do, you\\'re the one they\\'re counting on to pick them up. ', ' While there\\'s no one right way to deal with a toddler\\'s temper tantrum, most experts agree on what doesn\\'t work. At the top of the \"don\\'t\" list are yelling and spanking (or hitting of any kind), but tactics such as bribing, begging, and giving in aren\\'t great either. \"If you give in, you are rewarding the tantrum and ensuring that it will happen again and again,\" says Dr. Rubinowitz. Kids need to know that \"no\" means \"no,\" even if they are upset about it.  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), parents who react calmly and consistently to their toddler\\'s outbursts help their child understand where the boundaries are, which can help the child feel more protected and in control. The late sociologist Murray Straus, Ph.D., added one caution: \"When disciplining, it\\'s important to focus on behavior and not emotionally attack your child. People say, \\'That\\'s unrealistic.\\' But it\\'s not unrealistic to refrain from yelling at co-workers. We have to treat our children at least as well as we treat our colleagues.\"  Need help dealing with your own kid\\'s tantrums? Here are some tricks to try mid-meltdown. ', ' Does your child become aggressive during a meltdown—hitting, kicking, biting, or throwing things? Stop them immediately and remove them from the situation. Make it clear that while their feelings are OK, hurting others or themselves is not. Think: \"It\\'s OK to be angry at me, but it\\'s not OK to hit. I will not let you hit me.\" Or: \"Your block tower fell over and you\\'re mad. That\\'s OK. But it\\'s not OK to throw your blocks.\"  Remain calm, but be firm. When it comes to aggressive behavior, it\\'s best to have a zero-tolerance policy, says the AAP. ', ' Remember, your child will follow your lead when it comes to handling their anger. If you yell, they will end up matching your volume because, deep down, they want to engage and connect with you. Focusing on the fact that they\\'re feeling frustrated or sad may help you remain calm in the midst of the chaos.  If you do raise your voice, which happens to the best of us, apologize and ask for a do-over: \"I didn\\'t mean to yell at you. I\\'m sorry. That is not how I want to talk to you. Can we start over?\" In essence, model the behavior you want to see from your toddler—including making mistakes and taking responsibility for them. No one is perfect. ', ' \"Sometimes a kid just needs to get their anger out. So let them!\" says Linda Pearson, R.N., a Denver-based family nurse practitioner and author of The Discipline Miracle. (Just make sure there\\'s nothing around that could hurt them or others.)  \"I\\'m a big believer in this approach because it helps children learn how to vent in a non-destructive way. They\\'re able to get their feelings out, pull themselves together, and regain self-control—without engaging in a yelling match or battle of wills with you.\"  Stay close: Be there for support and as a beacon of calm. The idea isn\\'t to ignore and disconnect from your child but to let them feel their feelings in a safe, supported space. ', ' Sometimes, it can be a smart strategy to give in a little. Just be aware of the balance. Use this strategy too often, and you\\'re setting yourself up for failure by potentially reinforcing the tantrum behavior, according to Dr. Rubinowitz.  But there are times when surrendering a little bit is OK. While bribery (\"I\\'ll give you ice cream if you stop crying!\") is rarely helpful in the long run, you might honor your child\\'s request to play the same song over and over in exchange for a peaceful car ride, for example. ', ' Tantrums can often be sidestepped with commands that are brief, simple, and to the point. The more specific they are, the better (\"Don\\'t hit the dog\"). If your toddler is stuck in a mood, give them a clear idea of what you want them to do; \"Let\\'s color\" gives them a task to complete, and is much less vague than commands like \"Be good.\" A change of scenery can also be effective (\"Time to water the flowers!\"). ', ' \"Children have pretty short attention spans—which means they\\'re usually easy to divert,\" says Dr. Levy. If your kid is about to go off the deep end at the supermarket because you won\\'t buy the super-sugary cereal, try switching gears and enthusiastically saying something like, \"Hey, we need some ice cream. Want to help me pick a flavor?\" or \"Oh, check out the lobster tank over there!\" ', ' \"This may feel like the last thing you want to do when your kid is throwing a tantrum, but it really can help them settle down,\" affirms Dr. Levy. \"I\\'m talking about a big, firm hug, not a super cuddly one. And don\\'t say a word when you do it—again, you\\'d just be entering into a futile battle of wills. Hugs make kids feel secure and let them know that you care about them, even if you don\\'t agree with their behavior.\" ', ' Is your toddler screaming and crying because they can\\'t put on their shoes? Help them master that task so that they can feel a sense of accomplishment instead. If they want to do something unsafe, like climb a ladder, acknowledge their desire to do it, but restate your rule: \"I know you want to climb up high, but that\\'s not allowed.\" Try an alternative, if possible: \"You can climb the slide ladder at the park.\" ', \" If your child is having a public tantrum, pick them up and calmly carry them to a safe place. Take them to your car or a public restroom, where they can blow off steam. Once you're there, gently explain your position, and remain calm. Sometimes just touching or stroking a child can soothe them. \", ' Before you take your child grocery shopping, make sure they have eaten and slept well. Bring an interactive toy or a book in the car, then ask them to pick out things to buy at the store. You might even keep a paper and pen on you to write down the items they suggest, says Alan Greene, M.D., a father of four and adjunct clinical professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine.  At the end of the trip, read back some of their healthier food choices and let them get one or two things. Compiling a list will distract them and make them feel included, plus it promises a reward at the finish line. ', ' Toddlers don\\'t like surprises. The next time you\\'re about to leave the park or a friend\\'s house, defuse a potential eruption by giving them plenty of advance notice. They will be comforted by knowing what\\'s going to come next.  Tell them, \"You can ride your scooter two more times around the park, then we have to go home.\" This gives them a sense of control, and works better than saying, \"You can ride your scooter for five minutes.\" Since most toddlers can\\'t tell time, they\\'ll feel ambushed when it\\'s time to go. ', ' Public tantrums can be so challenging that some parents give in simply to reduce embarrassment, but this response only encourages children to repeat the behavior. \"Kids, even very young ones, are smart,\" says Alan E. Kazdin, Ph.D., a professor emeritus of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University. \"If you get angry or stressed, or cave in and let them get their way just to end the meltdown before more people start staring, they\\'ll learn that—aha!—it works.\"Your best bet, Dr. Kazdin explains, is to suck it up, plaster a Mona Lisa smile on your face, and pretend everything is just peachy. And what are others thinking? \"We know from studies that the only thing people judge is your reaction to the meltdown,\" says Dr. Levy. \"If you look calm like you\\'ve got it under control—even though you\\'re not doing anything to stop the fit—they think, \\'Now that\\'s a good parent.\\'\" ', \" After a tantrum subsides, revisit the original request you made that got your child so upset. If they threw a tantrum because you told them to pick up a toy, they should still pick up that toy once they're calm. If they went off the rails because you said they couldn't have a cookie, then don't give them the cookie when the tears stop. But when your child follows through and does something you asked of them, offer praise. After all, it's the positive behavior you want them to remember and repeat. \", ' Many children seem to snap out of a tantrum as quickly and inexplicably as they got into one in the first place. After it ends, go to your child, give them a hug and a kiss, tell them you love them, and move on. Dwelling on the outburst only makes them feel bad and may even cause the tantrum to start up again.  If you still want to discuss it with your 3- or 4-year-old, wait several hours before you do. Then, ask your child what set them off, and help them think about problem-solving approaches for the future. ', ' Don\\'t allow yourself to feel guilty or out of control because your child has a momentary breakdown. Though having a toddler shout \"I hate you\" can be hurtful, it\\'s important to remember that your child\\'s actions are not so much directed at you as they are a show of their own frustration. Tantrums pass and all of it will soon be a distant memory for your toddler. Make sure you don\\'t hold onto it, either. ', \" Coping with your toddler's tantrums can be difficult, to say the least. However, it can help to remember that they are challenging for your child, too. Often, your toddler is just working through their emotions and doesn't know what else to do to show they are upset. So, rather than viewing tantrums as a behavior problem, look at them as learning opportunities and times when your child needs extra support.

Parents who\\'ve been there speak candidly about the challenges, the self-doubt, and a protective love that\\'s especially fierce.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  From the beginning, Anna\\'s firstborn, Brynn, was an \"easy\" baby. She slept well, had a developmentally normal toddlerhood, and today is a go-with-the-flow kind of kid who rarely causes trouble. In Anna\\'s early years of parenting, she felt confident, as if she and her husband were doing something right.  Three years after Brynn\\'s birth, they had Sophie. \"She was a good baby until she wasn\\'t,\" says Anna, whose name, along with her children\\'s and those of the other families in this story, have been changed. Sophie ditched naps early and refused to settle down at night. She moved quickly from walking to climbing onto the kitchen counters. She lunged for the hot stove, hated getting ready in the morning, and threw all-too-frequent temper tantrums. Sticker charts and other positive reinforcement techniques that had worked so well for Brynn did nothing to motivate Sophie to change her behavior.  These days, the two girls—and how Anna parents them—couldn\\'t be more different. She admits to being lax with Sophie because she dreads the meltdowns. Anna and her husband often argue about how to handle their younger daughter, and they avoid family outings that might set her off.  \"I\\'m kind and loving with Sophie, but then I lose it, and I worry that she\\'s the way she is because I yell at her,\" says Anna. \"Everything I\\'ve read says I should be patient and consistent. But patience and consistency are two things you have the least of when your child constantly pushes your buttons.\" ', ' Anyone with two or more kids knows that siblings may live under one roof with the same rules but they come into the world with their own unique personalities and temperaments. And you\\'re never the same parent twice. \"Some parents receive much harder assignments than others,\" says Perri Klass, M.D., co-author of Quirky Kids. \"If you have a child with a more challenging temperament, the truth is that you may have less fun parenting on a day-to-day basis for some of your child\\'s life.\"  It\\'s perfectly understandable to feel frustrated that your kid seems to be more difficult to manage than all three of your friend\\'s kids combined or to be upset that your parenting is being unfairly judged by strangers and family. You have one of the hardest jobs there is: surviving your child\\'s tough stages without losing your confidence or mind. ', ' It\\'s not just parents\\' perception that certain kids are way more challenging: Science has proved it. Research by Harvard University psychologist Jerome Kagan, Ph.D., suggests that an infant\\'s temperament at birth is a good predictor of a child\\'s behavior in adolescence.  He found that 40% of babies have a calm disposition (they\\'re not overly ruffled by stimuli like light or noise), and years later, these kids remain chill. However, as many as 15% to 20% of babies are born with a more \"reactive\" temperament, and your friends and family might politely call them a \"handful.\" In Dr. Kagan\\'s study, these babies recoiled from lights and noise and were hard to soothe.  If you have a \"difficult\" baby, does this mean they—and you—are destined for even harder times ahead? Definitely not. \"There\\'s always that nature-versus-nurture controversy,\" says Nancy Snidman, Ph.D., director of the child development unit in psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who conducted the research with Dr. Kagan and continues to study the temperament of children. \"However, parents, other kids, and teachers can help shape a child\\'s personality and coping skills over time.\"  In other words, \"good\" parenting may not have as much of an impact on babies, but older kids with a tougher temperament can benefit from thoughtful and consistent parenting. ', ' One of the most trying parts of having a child who\\'s more difficult than the other is the worry that your easier little one is getting less attention from you. \"My daughter likes to take long naps, read quietly, and cuddle. My son won\\'t nap for more than an hour, demands constant attention, throws himself headfirst down the slide, and runs away in crowded places,\" says Nicole of her 2-year-old twins.  She ropes her amenable daughter into going along with her son\\'s interests to try to get one of the heavily advertised benefits of having twins: kids who play together. And when she can handle only one twin at a time, Nicole leaves her girl with a sitter, simply because it\\'s easier to disrupt her daughter\\'s usual caregiving than her son\\'s. \"I struggle with guilt,\" says Nicole. \"I have a hard time keeping her from feeling left out.\"  Rachel says her 7-year-old daughter used to think it was unfair when her 10-year-old brother (who has been diagnosed with both attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism) got his way more often than she did. \"Every now and then, I\\'ll take her out without her brother and let her decide what we\\'ll do,\" says Rachel. As a result, the sibling bond has strengthened as they\\'ve grown. \"I\\'ve never told my kids that they were \\'easy\\' or \\'hard,\\' but my daughter understands that her brother has special challenges,\" says Rachel.  Likewise, Jen, a mother of five girls, tries not to show that she\\'s annoyed when her youngest lags behind as they\\'re getting ready to leave the house. \"I\\'ll say something like, \\'I guess Emma needs extra time today. Let\\'s all give her a couple of minutes.\\'\" ', ' There are some things that Rachel\\'s son can\\'t do, and then there\\'s stuff he doesn\\'t want to do—like being in a recent recorder concert. \"It was a perfect storm of everything he hates, including dressing up and being in a crowded theater,\" she says.  \"I had to balance how much to push him with how much he was struggling and whether it was because of his diagnosis or just defiance.\" Ultimately, he performed in the concert after agreeing to a couple of compromises, such as wearing a soft polo rather than a button-down dress shirt.  Jen, too, has come up with her own strategies to minimize the impact that her youngest\\'s fidgety behavior has on the family. \"For instance, we have her sit at the end of the table at a restaurant because we know she\\'s going to want to pop up to go to the bathroom,\" she says. \"Plus, we all find value in it: She\\'s also happy to jump up to get more crayons or napkins or an extra menu.\"  Certainly, when you understand what\\'s causing your child\\'s behavior, you may occasionally need to remind yourself that they\\'re not acting that way on purpose. Molly, whose son has autism, says, \"A favorite quote of mine that makes the rounds in the autism community but I think can be applied to anyone is, \\'My child isn\\'t giving me a hard time. My child is having a hard time.\\' Remembering this shifts how you react.\" Sometimes that reaction is the only thing you\\'re able to control. ', ' There\\'s no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting, but research has found that kids who struggle more with negative emotions are most responsive to an empathetic yet structured and consistent parenting style. Rachel says her son seeks affection when he\\'s struggling. \"Sometimes he\\'ll say to me, \\'Mommy, I need a hug,\\' and I get all the warm fuzzies,\" she says.  There are days when staying upbeat is a tall order. For Jen, it helps to think of her younger daughter\\'s challenges as superpowers: \"Yes, she\\'s stubborn, but that also means she\\'s tenacious.\"  Of course, we all have moments when we\\'ve regretted how we reacted to our kid\\'s behavior. But the hopeful news, experts say, is that kids are resilient and they love us. \"One of the great things about life with small children is you get to wake up every morning and have a fresh start,\" says Dr. Klass.  Another bonus of having two very different children: The experience makes you a more understanding, patient person and one who\\'s in this for the long game with plenty of supportive company. \"I used to judge others a lot,\" says Anna. \"Now, when I see a kid acting up, I\\'ll say to the mom, \\'Oh, I have one of those too\\' or \\'That reminds me of my Sophie,\\' and give her a smile. It\\'s good to know you\\'re not alone.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.  ', ' Reward systems rely on positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior. Here\\'s how to make reward systems work for toddlers, preschoolers, and school-aged kids.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Many parents swear by rewards systems to help kids reach behavioral milestones (and tame a few tantrums on the way). Rewards charts encourage behavioral modification through positive reinforcement—though it should be noted that children’s social-emotional development is a learned process that reflects their maturation and growth  \"Stressing positive behavior helps build self-esteem,\" says Katarzyna Bisaga, M.D., Ph.D., a child, and adolescent psychiatrist and assistant clinical professor in Columbia University\\'s Division of Child Psychiatry in New York City. The thinking is that when a child develops a positive behavior and gets a lot of praise, they\\'ll be more likely to repeat the behavior in the future.  Read on to learn more about reward charts and the age groups and situations that benefit from them the most. ', ' Here\\'s an example of how reward systems work: When Dr. Bisaga\\'s son Marcin was 7 years old, she struggled to get him ready for school in the morning. Rather than dwelling on the negative aspects of his foot-dragging, she stressed the positives, clarified her expectations, and implemented a point reward system for kids.  \"In the morning, Marcin got points for getting dressed by a certain time, brushing his teeth, and eating his breakfast,\" she says. \"When he came home from school, there were points for putting his coat and shoes away and for washing his hands. At night there were points for taking a bath and brushing his teeth.\" They tallied the results at the end of the week, and he earned 10 cents for every three points. Marcin would look forward to buying trading cards and small toys with his loot.  Want to implement a similar reward system in your house? The key is customizing it based on your child\\'s age, personality, and interests. Here\\'s how to set up a reward system that works for your kid. ', \" For little kids, consider using a sticker reward chart. The instructions are simple: Put one sticker on the chart each time your child accomplishes a goal, such as getting dressed. It's often helpful to have both short-term and long-term goals; for example, maybe they get to watch a favorite video after three stickers, and they get a larger reward (such as a small toy) after 10 stickers. If your child can't count, you can make a grid on the chart, and they can get a reward after completing a line. Parents should avoid bribing a child by giving extra rewards for good behavior; instead, the chart should focus only on the designated tasks.  Printable reward charts are readily available online, and you can also make your own DIY version. Also, note that you don't need to work with stickers. Reward charts can take many forms: dimes in a jar, magnets on the fridge, child-friendly apps, tallied points—anything that'll motivate your child. Just remember that most little kids do best with a bit of visual representation.  Here are some tips for using a reward chart for toddlers and preschoolers. \", \" To eliminate confusion, you should give the visual reward immediately after the desired behavior occurs, says Dr. Bisaga. Otherwise, your child might forget why they're getting a reward. \", ' When starting a reward system, only track and reward one behavior at a time. For example, your toddler or preschooler can get stickers for using the toilet, getting dressed, saying \"thank you,\" or not whining—but not all at the same time. Instead, start with one and once that specific behavior is no longer a problem, Dr. Bisaga says you can target another, always making sure your goals are realistic and age-appropriate. ', ' Toddlers and preschoolers love pleasing their parents. So, give your child lots of praise when they accomplish a goal, and they\\'ll be encouraged to keep up the good work. Also, remind them about the reward chart often: \"Remember if you go potty on the toilet, you\\'ll get a sticker!\" ', ' With toddlers and preschoolers, you need to speak in easy-to-understand terms. For example, instead of rewarding your child for \"showing gratitude for acts of service,\" you\\'re rewarding them for \"saying \\'please\\' and \\'thank you.\" ', \" Even if you're desperate to get your child to behave in public, you shouldn't use a reward system as a bribe. Your child might start acting out on purpose, knowing that a reward awaits when they stop. Instead, you might explain to your child what behavior is expected, and that this behavior will earn them a sticker. \", ' For school-aged kids, a reward system usually deals with points instead of stickers. But tracking points alone won\\'t motivate most kids to change their behavior, so parents need to encourage them with larger incentives.  For example, kids can trade in a certain number of points for specific rewards, such as:  A trip to the playground  A later bedtime  An extra half hour of video games  Small amounts of money  Older kids might earn daily, weekly, and long-term awards. For example, each day that they get a certain number of points, they can play their video game, and after a certain number of points in one week, they earn extra video game time on the weekend. (Say every 20 points gets you an extra hour, so your kid doesn\\'t just \"stop acting good\\' after they reach 20 points). A longer-term reward could happen when your child accumulates a certain number of points over a month, and it might be something like a new video game.  Here are some tips for success with a point reward system for older kids. ', \" You can implement more items in the reward chart as your kids get older. For example, your child might earn points for making their bed, controlling their anger, helping with laundry, walking the dog, and being nice to siblings. You might give more points for harder or important tasks (doing homework could be worth more than making the bed, for instance). Make sure to clearly define expectations so there's no arguing over whether the reward is earned. \", ' Parents can decide on the dynamics of their reward system, but some choose to also remove points for misbehavior. If this happens, clearly explain the reasoning to your child and remind them how they can earn points back. That said, some experts advise against removing points because it could negatively affect motivation. Instead, you might pick a few major misbehaviors and have pre-set penalties for those. The penalties can be things such as doing extra chores, having to wait a few hours before using their reward, or only getting half the extra time on the video game. ', ' Does your kid have a knack for procrastination? Add a time sensitivity element to your reward system! For example, maybe they must make their bed before 10 a.m. to receive points, or they need to complete all chores before dinner. ', \" Talk to your child to brainstorm accessible rewards that will motivate them. For example, they might not care about getting a new book if they already have shelves full of unread ones—but maybe they're longing for a family bike ride to the new ice cream shop! \", ' Reward charts clearly state your expectations, but they only work as long as you keep at it. \"Even simple star charts require a lot of energy, effort, and time,\" says Dr. Bisaga. \"You need to be on top of your kids and monitor what they\\'re doing and how they\\'re doing it.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.  ', \" When it comes to dealing with bad behavior, every parent screws up sometimes. Learn about seven common discipline mistakes and how to fix them.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Children behave in predictable patterns, says Parents advisor Michele Borba, Ed.D., author of The Big Book of Parenting Solutions. They usually act the same when they're tired, hungry, or getting fed up—and it's an adult's job to take note and adjust accordingly. Ignoring a kid's signs is one of many discipline mistakes moms and dads make all the time, but fixing them can make a huge difference in the parenting experience. We asked experts to reveal the most common disciple missteps with easy solutions to implement today. \", ' \"Don\\'t hit your sister!\" \"Stop pulling the dog\\'s tail!\" The number of things you tell your toddler or preschooler not to do is endless.  The Solution: Ask for the behavior you want to see. Nobody wants to raise a child who doesn\\'t understand limits, but \"parents say \\'no\\' so frequently that kids become deaf to it, and the word loses its power,\" Dr. Borba explains. Moreover, \"we often tell kids not to do something without letting them know what they should be doing,\" notes Linda Sonna, Ph.D., author of The Everything Toddler Book.  Save the naysaying for truly dangerous situations (think: fork in the electrical socket or your child eating the spider plant), and focus on telling kids how you would like them to behave. For example, instead of, \"No standing in the bathtub!\" try, \"We sit down in the bathtub because it\\'s slippery.\" Later, when you notice your kid splashing away in a seated position, offer some praise (\"I like how you\\'re sitting!\") to reinforce their good behavior. ', ' You\\'re sitting in church when your toddler shouts. As soon as you shush them, they do it again. Mortifying! Why don\\'t they listen?  The Solution: Play teacher. Very young children still haven\\'t developed impulse control or learned the social graces required in public places like stores and restaurants. \"Parents assume kids know more than they do,\" Dr. Sonna says.  When your child breaks a norm, remind yourself that they aren\\'t trying to be a pain—they just don\\'t know how to act in the situation, so snapping isn\\'t effective (or fair). Focus on showing your child how you want them to behave, softly saying things like, \"I\\'m being quiet because I\\'m in church, but if I need something from Dad I lean in close to whisper.\" Also point out what others are doing (\"Look how Charlie is coloring while he waits for his meal to arrive\"). Kids are born mimics, so modeling or drawing attention to something we want them to do goes a long way.  \"It takes time and repetition for kids to learn to handle themselves,\" Dr. Sonna says, which means you should expect to give your kid a lot of reminders—and remove them when they don\\'t get the message. Over time, they\\'ll learn how to act. ', ' When you drop something, you yell. A man cuts you off and you call him a rude name. But then you get mad if your kid reacts the same way when things don\\'t go their way.  The Solution: Apologize and take a do-over. There\\'s a boomerang effect to behavior: If we yell, our kids probably will too, says Devra Renner, coauthor of Mommy Guilt. Yes, it\\'s hard to be on perfect behavior around the clock, so apologize when you do slip up. \"Emotions are powerful and difficult to control, even for grown-ups,\" Renner notes, but saying \"sorry\" demonstrates that we\\'re accountable for our actions nonetheless. It also creates the chance to talk about why you reacted the way you did and offers appropriate ways to respond when you\\'re feeling frustrated. ', \" You hear your children chasing each other around the house and immediately shout.  The Solution: Ignore selectively. Often, parents feel the need to step in every time kids do something, well, kid-like. But always being the bad guy is exhausting, Dr. Borba notes. Keep in mind that children sometimes do things that are irksome because they're exploring new skills. (So your toddler could be dumping juice into their cereal because they're learning about liquids.) Other times, they're seeking attention.  When it comes to reacting, Dr. Borba's rule of thumb is: When safety isn't an issue, try watchful waiting. If your 6-year-old is playing their recorder with their nose, try not to shout. See what happens if you just continue with what you're doing as if nothing is happening. Most likely, if you don't respond, they will eventually stop—and you'll feel calmer, having avoided a shouting match. \", ' \"Turn off the TV... I\\'m serious this time... Really!\" Your kids continue bad behavior when warnings are vague for the same reason you run yellow lights—there aren\\'t consequences.  The Solution: Set limits and follow through. Nagging, second chances, and negotiation all convey that cooperation is optional, says Robert MacKenzie, Ph.D., author of Setting Limits With Your Strong-Willed Child. To teach kids to follow rules, make expectations clear, then take action when they\\'re broken. If you want your kid to, say, get off the couch and do homework, start with respectful directives (\"Please turn off the TV now and do your work\"). If they follow through, thank them. If not, give a consequence: \"I\\'m turning off the TV now. Until your work is finished, your TV privileges are suspended.\" ', ' When you send your 3-year-old to their room for hitting their brother, they start banging their head on the floor in rage.  The Solution: Consider a time-in. A time-out is meant to be a chance for a child to calm down, not a punishment. Some kids respond well to the suggestion that they go to a quiet room until they\\'re chill. But others view it as a rejection, and it riles them up. Plus, it doesn\\'t teach kids how you want them to behave. As an alternative, Dr. Sonna suggests taking a \"time-in,\" where you sit quietly with your kid. If they\\'re very upset, hold them until they settle down, Dr. Sonna adds. Once they\\'re relaxed, calmly explain why the behavior wasn\\'t okay. Too angry to comfort them? Put yourself in time-out; once you\\'ve relaxed, discuss what you would like your child to do differently. You might start by saying: \"What can you do instead of hitting when Milo grabs your train?\" ', ' The best way to deal with your son\\'s whining is to get down at eye level and explain how their actions need to change. But your daughter is more aggressive and refuses to listen.  The Solution: Develop a diverse toolbox. It\\'s easy to blame your kid when a discipline technique fails. But \"you may have to go about getting the behavior you want in different ways with each kid,\" notes Avivia Pflock, coauthor of Mommy Guilt. While one child might respond to a verbal reminder about what is acceptable, the other might need a consequence when they act up, like having the Wii unplugged. Being firm with one child and touchy-feely with another isn\\'t being inconsistent; it\\'s tuning in to different needs and learning styles, Pflock assures. \"The punishment should fit the crime—and the kid.\"  Starting a Family  Pregnancy  Babies  Raising Kids  Family Life  Staying Healthy  News & Trends  Your Village  About Us  Expert Review Board  Editorial Guidelines  Product Review Guidelines  Diversity Pledge  Privacy Policy  Careers  Terms of Use  Contact  Advertise  Do Not Sell My Personal Information  By clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.  ', ' Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Both of my children were potty trained by age 3--during the day, at least. My older daughter had three dry nights in a row a few months before she turned 5, so we put her in underwear, and to this date she\\'s never had an accident. (She\\'s 9 now.) When my younger daughter\\'s 5th birthday came and went with her still in diapers at bedtime, I didn\\'t think much of it--different kid, different timetable. Her pediatrician wasn\\'t concerned, either. But then Lila\\'s 6th birthday passed, and she told me she was too embarrassed to have friends over in case they saw her Pullups in her closet. Shortly after, I heard a discouraging stat: Only 15% of bedwetters become dry on their own a year later. So if we waited for things to get better, it could literally take years. It was time to deal with this.  First, I wanted to rule out any medical causes for her bedwetting. (Excessive urination is a common red flag of diabetes, for example.) Once we learned that everything was normal, we focused on bedwetting treatment options. Research shows that medication is not as effective as a bed alarm. And age 6 is a good time to start using an alarm; younger children don\\'t respond very well. So my husband and I geared ourselves up for what an alarm would mean for all of us. Put simply: bad sleep, and a lot of laundry, for the next several months.  We had one huge advantage, which was a willing child. Lila was totally motivated to stop bedwetting, and she found the idea of an alarm sort of fascinating. We got the kind that has two parts: a sensor that clips to her underwear and a transmitter that attaches to the shoulder of her pajama top, beeping loudly when the sensor gets wet. (We also invested in a super-absorbent pad that we attached to the top of her mattress and always had a pile of clean sheets and blankets waiting on the floor.) We explained that when the alarm went off, we\\'d turn it off and help her to the bathroom. This was a key step, having her go to the toilet even if her bladder was completely empty. The hope was that she\\'d eventually turn off the alarm when she was wet and head to the bathroom on her own. But the goal was for the alarm to train her reflex system to tell her when her bladder was full and send her to the bathroom before she urinated.  I can\\'t say we saw much success. For the first several weeks, that dreaded alarm woke me and my husband--though not Lila--every night, sometimes twice. I tracked each night in a simple chart that came with the bed alarm; I didn\\'t see much of a pattern to her accidents. Sometimes they happened before midnight, other times they weren\\'t until 4 or 5 in the morning. We tried limiting how much water she drank, and woke her to use the bathroom before we went to bed, so there\\'d ostensibly be less urine in her bladder for the night. But experts don\\'t encourage that because while it does cut back on accidents, it doesn\\'t help the brain and bladder communicate with each other.  Then, through the good fortune of my job here, I met a father-son team of bedwetting experts in town from Israel. Jacob Sagie, Ph.D., and his son, Tal Sagie, M.A., have treated more than 30,000 bedwetters in the past three decades. They\\'ve now created a new program called TheraPee. It requires an alarm (though a different kind—I\\'ll explain), but what sets it apart is the online component.  The Sagies knew that they\\'d been successful with their patients, who ranged in age from 4 to 35, because they were able to meet face to face. With TheraPee, they\\'re replicating the in-person experience in the form of hundreds of brief video clips tailored to your child\\'s situation. Here\\'s how it works: You initially provide information about your child, including age, gender, duration of bedwetting, and more. Based on that data, the appropriate video will play, starring Tal, who speaks directly to your child, welcoming her to the program. (That\\'s him in the photo illustration above.) Lila looked at me in amazement and said, \"Is he really talking to me?\"\\x9d She was enthralled. This is the point, says Tal: \"The soul of the treatment is the therapist. His ability to establish a trusting relationship with your child, knowing how to motivate him, and always giving him hope and helping him believe in himself, are the key elements for success.\"\\x9d This is why the videos rely heavily on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. For example, your child will watch a clip that incorporates modeling by showing thank-you notes and progress charts from successful former TheraPee patients.  A word about the charts: They were a big deal for Lila. With the first treatment method we tried, I kept my own records. Dr. Sagie pointed out that we were missing a critical opportunity to motivate Lila and help her feel invested in the process. What\\'s more, my chart was ugly to look at. TheraPee\\'s online chart requires more information, including the size of the wet spot, the time of night the accident occurred, and whether your child woke up on her own. It\\'s easy for kids to fill it out themselves. And when they have a dry night, they get to put a blue star on that square. After four dry nights in a row, they get a red star. And after eight consecutive dry nights, they get a much-sought-after gold star. I couldn\\'t believe how genuinely excited Lila was to place her stars on the chart, and how much she was keeping tabs on which color star she was due for. After two weeks of reporting results, Lila would have another session with Tal, using videos tailored specifically to her progress. (One note: His accent is strong, and I was certain Lila was going to find it distracting. To my surprise, it only seemed to make her pay more attention to what he was saying.) In the video clips, he would praise her progress, cheer her on, give mini quizzes to make sure she understood what she was being told (\"What kind of star will you get for one dry night?\"\\x9d), and give us homework—daily exercises that would help strengthen her bladder or improve her reflex system. One such exercise required her to urinate for three seconds, stop for three seconds, and repeat that pattern until she was finished. (There are much more sophisticated exercises for children who use the program for a longer period than Lila did.)  Another difference this time around was the alarm itself. Lila wasn\\'t physically attached to it anymore (many kids resist that kind, says Tal). Instead, we put a sensor pad under her sheet that plugged into an alarm box right next to her bed.  Since mid-November, Lila has had a total of three accidents. She \"graduated\"\\x9d from TheraPee in early February. As a way of celebrating, Lila got to virtually meet Tal via Skype, which was nothing short of a thrill for her, after all of her video sessions. This isn\\'t necessarily typical, but \"we do our best to assist all patients by phone, email, or Skype if they need our help during the program,\"\\x9d he says.  The program isn\\'t cheap: You can either pay $279 for the alarm and unlimited access to the software, or $199 plus a $19.99 monthly fee (perhaps a better option if your child is very close to having dry nights). But the Sagies say their success rate with TheraPee is 90%, and it\\'s clear from these glowing reviews on Amazon that it\\'s working for many, many more children out there. If you\\'re interested, you can get a free consultation. And should you use it, I wish you and your child the best.  Kara Corridan is the health director of Parents. Now that Lila\\'s bedwetting days are over, she\\'s moved on to a loft bed, where she sleeps soundly every night.

All young children wake multiple times per night. Whatever happens at bedtime is usually what is needed during the night to fall back to sleep. So start with making changes at bedtime, decreasing her bottle by an ounce per night. Substitute a snack, such as some cheese or yogurt, if you are concerned about her being hungry. Once she is able to fall asleep without a bedtime bottle, do the same during the night, dropping her nighttime bottles by an ounce per night. Once your daughter is no longer needing a bottle to help her fall asleep, she will likely start sleeping for longer stretches at night (and no longer soaking her diaper!).

Although it’s likely that your son’s middle-of-the-night thirst is nothing more than a behavioral issue, it could be a symptom of diabetes. In addition to increased thirst, other symptoms of diabetes include increased hunger and more frequent urination. Children with diabetes might also seem irritable and fatigued, and they often lose weight and develop a yeast infection in the diaper area. If your son’s pediatrician is concerned about diabetes, he or she will order a blood test.  If your son’s pediatrician rules out diabetes and other physical causes of increased thirst, you can rest assured that your son’s middle-of-the-night drinking is nothing more than a habit. Make sure he gets plenty to drink during the day, and then stop offering him a drink when he wakes up in the middle of the night.

', \" Worried about your child wetting the bed? Here are 8 tips and tricks to help them stop.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Bedwetting can be an embarrassing issue among kids, but it's actually very common. The National Institutes of Health states that nocturnal enuresis or nighttime incontinence (the medical terms for bedwetting) is involuntary urination after age 5 or 6, and that more than 5 million children experience it. According to the Mayo Clinic, 15 percent of children wet the bed at age 5 but less than 5 percent of kids do so by ages 8 to 11. Bedwetting tends to run in families and is more common among boys than girls; experts estimate the ratio as roughly 2 boys to 1 girl. Although most children eventually outgrow this phase, here are eight steps you can take to help your child keep dry through the night.  Related: Top 10 Bed-Wetting Myths \", ' Getting angry with your little one and punishing them for wetting the bed will only add pressure to stay dry—and will make the problem worse. \"It\\'s difficult to stop a child from wetting the bed, and you shouldn\\'t worry about it unless they\\'re embarrassed and ask you for help,\" says Scott J. Goldstein, M.D., an Instructor of Clinical Pediatrics at Northwestern University School of Medicine in Chicago. Don\\'t make a big deal out of it; offer some comfort instead. \"Often, when parents don\\'t talk about bedwetting, children think they are the only ones going through it,\" points out Howard J. Bennett, M.D., a pediatrician in Washington, D.C., and author of the American Academy of Pediatrics\\' Waking Up Dry. \"Reassure your child that they are not alone, and that bedwetting is actually very normal at their age.\" ', \" Tell your pediatrician about bedwetting so they can track your child's progress and offer suggestions for handling the situation. If your child is older than 5, or if the bedwetting starts abruptly, discuss if there is a reason why it's occurring, suggests Mark Wolraich, M.D., Director of the Child Study Center at University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Talk to your doctor about possible causes—for instance, urinary tract infections, diabetes, or even stress—and other reasons and medical solutions. Keep in mind, though, that in many cases there isn't a physical reason for bedwetting. It's just a delay in the development of nighttime bladder control. \", ' Make sure your child goes to the bathroom before their bedtime, but also try carrying them to the bathroom again right before you go to bed. \"When your child empties their bladder, there\\'s less of a chance they\\'ll have to urinate during at night,\" explains Dr. Goldstein. This technique won\\'t \"cure\" bedwetting, so to speak, but it can be an effective way to keep the bed dry through the night. Some pediatricians also suggest limiting your child\\'s intake of fluids a few hours before bedtime. ', ' Consider adding a positive incentive, which can work on a subconscious level, to help your child end bedwetting. For instance, make a grid chart or use a calendar, and give your child a sticker (like a shiny star or a happy face) every night they stay dry. When they earns ten stickers—which might take longer for some kids, so have patience and continue to encourage them—they get a small toy or a special treat, like a lollipop, for their progress. \"The power of positive suggestion does work for some children,\" says Dr. Bennett. \"But remember, in the case of bedwetting, the opposite of reward is not punishment.\" ', ' Constipation is a common cause for bladder problems. When the rectum, located just behind the bladder, is filled with large or hard poop, there is more pressure on the bladder. This causes bladder instability, which, in turn, can lead to nighttime (or even daytime) accidents, explains Dr. Bennett. He suggests that parents get \"back into the poop loop.\" If you notice that your child isn\\'t having a daily bowel movement or if their stool is typically hard, increase his fluid and fiber intake. Apple juice, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are all good options to help ease constipation and get the system working better again. ', ' Medication is also an option, but it has potential side effects. For instance, desmopressin, which reduces urine production, can cause headaches, facial flushing, nausea, and, in rare cases, severe water retention. Some medicine tends to control symptoms rather than cure bedwetting. \"The second you stop the medication, the bedwetting might start again,\" says Dr. Bennett. Discuss with your pediatrician the types of prescription medication choices that are available. ', ' A moisture alarm wakes your child the second they wet the bed. The interruption in sleep can condition the brain to control the bladder better and help prevent accidents. This method is about 75 percent effective, and tends to work when children themselves are ready to be dry. Dr. Bennett suggests the Malem alarm and the Rodger wireless alarm system, both of which can be purchased on Amazon.com. ', \" If moisture alarms and medication aren't for you, you can try simpler measures: Make sure the bed has a waterproof mattress cover or pad and pillow cases, and stock up on Pull-Ups. Lay fresh pajamas by your little one's bed for a quick change in the middle of the night. If your child sleeps through the night in a wet bed, you might want to ask them to help change the sheets in the morning—doing so can help them take responsibility for the bedwetting. Even if the child isn't wetting the bed on purpose, they're still aware of their accidents when they wake up. Helping change the sheets can make them feel like they are part of the solution rather than the problem. Then relax and be patient: This phase won't last forever. In almost all cases, children outgrow bedwetting.

Here\\'s why one mom finally gave in to the family bed.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  It\\'s 1 a.m. Suddenly, the bedroom door bangs open and the small, sturdy figure of my 5-year-old daughter stands framed in the doorway. She hesitates a moment, as if not quite sure where her sleepy feet have led her. Then, like a heat-seeking missile homing in on its target, she launches herself across the room and burrows into our bed. Again. Moriah has been making her way to our room every night for more than a year now. The youngest of my three children, she used to be our model sleeper. Then one night, something scary jarred her awake. I foolishly brought her into bed with us to console her, and that was our undoing.  For the next several months, she told us she couldn\\'t stay in her room because \"the neighbor\\'s dogs outside might come through my wall.\" Then she was worried about monsters. Now she cuts to the chase: \"I don\\'t want to be alone.\"  When I was growing up, my mother and father had no problem making their bed off-limits to us kids. Today, most parents I know can\\'t keep their kids out. Some simply endure the kicks and elbow jabs. Some play nightly musical beds. One couple I know gave up and moved all of the family\\'s mattresses onto the floor of their room.  Maybe this is just a reflection of the permissive parenting in San Francisco, where I live—at least that\\'s what a friend in Iowa tells me. In her circle, moms and dads tuck their kids in, kiss them good-night, and everyone stays put until morning.  It\\'s not as if either my husband or I ever intended to have a family bed. We scoffed at the notion that a family bed was \"natural\"; poverty, not preference, is what squeezes families together at night in many less-developed parts of the world, we decided. Much as I like cuddling with my kids, I also like my space. Indeed, some nights, our queen-size mattress barely feels big enough for two.  Over and over during the past year, we\\'ve hatched schemes to eject Moriah. We tried having her share a room downstairs with one of her older brothers. Still, she woke in the wee hours and padded back to us. Next plan: taking turns in her room in a sleeping bag on the floor. Sore shoulders and backs brought an end to that idea. Then we made a cozy nest of pads and pillows on the floor of our room, so Moriah could be near us, though not actually in our bed. But once I lay down, she flung herself across my legs and began wailing, \"I want to be with Mommy!\" The only way I could get her to settle down was by holding tightly onto her sweaty little hand. By morning, I couldn\\'t bend my elbow. ', ' The thing is, it takes a lot of energy to deal with sleep problems. And when you\\'re exhausted from dealing with them, it\\'s hard to muster the energy to be steadfast. All you want is sleep. Nothing feels as important as shutting your eyes -- not some lesson in independence, not the chance to talk with your mate, not even sex.  Still, my husband, Eric, and I were a whole lot firmer with our first two. As new parents eager to do the right thing, we wasted no time getting Eli, who\\'s now 12, into his own bed. The books said babies need to learn to fall asleep on their own. So we steeled ourselves against our son\\'s plaintive cries and, as advised, went back into his room only to offer quick pats on the back. We hung equally tough with Isaac, now 10.  Some might say we\\'ve caved in to the numeric disadvantage that occurs when you have a third child. I think my husband and I are simply at a different point in our lives than we were with our sons. We were six years into raising kids by the time Moriah came along. We had our experience to call on, that accrual of decisions that gradually teaches us what works and, more important, what kind of parenting feels right.  My Iowa friend suggests that I may be holding my daughter back by giving in to her every night. Some experts, she warns, would say I\\'m delaying Moriah\\'s independence to satisfy my own desire to savor every last sweet drop of her childhood. But I watch my daughter for signs of insecurity or evidence that she is overly attached. I see her proudly swing across the monkey bars at school and fearlessly race ahead of me on her scooter on our walks. I notice her readily making conversation with visiting grown-ups and easily reach out to make new friends. She\\'s doing just fine, I decide. I\\'m not holding her back; I\\'m helping her move forward. That reassuring togetherness at night is exactly the fuel she needs to strike out confidently on her own by day. This is just that rare moment in our lives when my daughter\\'s needs and my own coincide.  As much as I\\'ve complained about Moriah\\'s nightly forays, I know why I\\'m unable to get her out of my bed: I don\\'t really want to. She is, after all, my last child, still my baby. When my eldest, Eli, was her age, I couldn\\'t imagine a life beyond the nursery-school gates. Now Eli is on the cusp of adolescence, and I know how blindingly fast the years pass. I understand now, in a way that I didn\\'t with my sons, how brief this time of delicious late-night snuggles really is.  So I\\'ve stopped fighting it when the door bursts open at night and she scoots in next to me. She wraps her arms around my arm, presses close as if trying to get back under my skin. She gives me a quick kiss. \"Hi, sweetie,\" I say, kissing her back on her moist forehead. Then I roll over and go back to sleep.

Second, the classic sleep-training techniques you\\'ve heard about like \"Cry It Out\" won\\'t work. Your child is too stubborn and strong now—and most kids this age won\\'t just stay in bed and cry. But don\\'t despair! As the director of the Yale Pediatric Sleep Center, I know there are effective techniques for older children, and I\\'m going to share a few of my favorites.  Whichever method you choose, the solution is to peel back your involvement at bedtime by having your child deal with your absence for short periods of time, and then gradually increase that time. Also, when you return to their room after leaving them alone, you need to praise them like they just won the Nobel Prize. Say things like \"Look at you in your bed like a big kid! You look so comfortable! I am so proud of you for staying put and relaxing, just like we talked about!\" And if you don\\'t feel a bit embarrassed at how enthusiastic you\\'re being, lay it on even thicker. This over-the-top praise and attention is the best way to reinforce their efforts. ', ' I was a theater nerd in high school. With any production, you spend a lot of time practicing, and we had a tradition called \"Toga Night.\" Two nights before opening night, we would run the play, but instead of our normal costumes, we would wear bedsheets and throw cream pies in each other\\'s faces. It took the edge off of everyone\\'s nerves and reminded everyone to have fun.  I\\'m not suggesting that you throw a cream pie in your child\\'s face when they come out of their room for the tenth time. However, practicing a new bedtime plan during the day can help both parents and children who are terrified of making changes to their sleep routine. Here are a few essentials for successful rehearsals:  Do a mini version of bedtime. There\\'s no need to brush teeth and read a story (although you can), but do go through all the other steps of bedtime and your new sleep-training technique. This can include practicing meditation, talking about your day, crawling into bed, and then having the parent leave the room. Gush about your child\\'s success like you would when it\\'s actually nighttime. Practice the routine as often as needed so your child feels more comfortable with it.  Make it fun. Act goofy. First, you can pretend to be the child and have your child be the parent. Get into your pajamas if you have time, or have them practice putting their teddy bear to bed. If you don\\'t make this fun, they\\'ll be as unexcited about it as they are about their real bedtime.  Do it at least a few times per week. I know this can be difficult for working parents. The more you practice, the better it will go, but it\\'s fine if you\\'re only able to rehearse on the weekends.  Rehearse at least a few hours before bedtime. You don\\'t want to do this right before your child needs to go to sleep—that\\'s often already a fraught time. Instead, do it in the morning or in the afternoon. ', ' This is one of my favorite sleep-training methods because it\\'s so gentle. Before you begin, you\\'ll need to have an idea of how long it typically takes your child to fall asleep after you turn out the lights. Let\\'s say that you turn off the lights at 8:00 p.m. and they fall asleep at 8:20 p.m. In the middle of that 20-minute period, you\\'ll leave the room to \"take a break\" for a brief interval, and then return.  Here\\'s how it goes:  Rehearse the whole process once or twice during the day so that your child knows what to expect.  Go through your regular bedtime routine, ending with this mantra: \"I love you. It\\'s time to go to sleep. Good night.\" Then stay quietly in the room.  At 8:10 p.m., tell your child that you\\'re taking a quick break. Leave the room and promise you\\'ll come back soon.  Return to their room in one minute and praise your child extravagantly. \"Look what a big kid you are! You stayed in bed and are so cozy! Great job!\" Feel free to give hugs and kisses too.  Stay until they fall asleep.  Do the same thing the next night, except leave the room for two minutes. The night after that, leave for three minutes. Your child will slowly increase their capacity to be alone at night—and your goal is for them to fall asleep during one of the breaks. If they do, it\\'s still crucial that you follow through on your promise to return to their room.  Once your child falls asleep independently for a week (or you\\'re taking a 30-minute break), you can stop. ', ' This is a different variation that involves taking multiple, very short breaks, and it works for children who tend to cry, scream, or get up when you leave even briefly. However, it\\'ll require a higher level of energy from you. As before, rehearse this once or twice during the day so your child knows what to expect.  Go through your bedtime routine, and say good night.  A little bit after lights-out, tell your child that you need to step out for just a moment to do something. (This is called the \"Excuse-Me Drill\" because you say something along the lines of, \"Excuse me for a second—I need to check on the soufflé/basketball game score/price of Bitcoin.\")  Stay out for 30 or 60 seconds, or the amount of time your child can typically tolerate without getting out of bed. Return and praise your child extravagantly.  A little bit later, step out again for a very brief interval.  On night one, you\\'ll do this 20 to 30 times. Every time you come back in, provide the affection and attention that reinforces your child\\'s bravery in being apart from you. On night two, you\\'ll gradually increase the amount of time you spend out of the room. Each night, the breaks will be longer and longer until your child starts falling asleep without you. Once they can do that for a week, your mission is accomplished.

Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  My 4-year-old son, Pete, came into my room and said something about breakfast. \"I\\'m up; I\\'m up,\" I said, wondering why my alarm hadn\\'t gone off. I headed toward the kitchen and noticed I was having trouble walking in a straight line. That\\'s when I saw the clock: It was 3:45 A.M.  I coaxed him back to bed, only to wake up two hours later to the sound of him playing with every car and truck in his toy box. At naptime, I thought he would fall asleep in a snap. No such luck. He tossed and turned, played with his cars, put on his Superman costume and jumped off his bed, until I finally -- an hour and a half later -- gave up on a nap.  Having endured bouts of insomnia myself during stressful times, I had to wonder if Pete was experiencing something similar. We\\'d recently moved cross-country, which meant he was getting used to a new house, a new climate, a new preschool, new friends, new everything. But was it possible for a 4-year-old to have insomnia? The thought struck me as silly.  It turns out that it\\'s not silly at all. In fact, there are more than 40 accredited pediatric sleep centers around the country established to help the estimated 20 to 30 percent of children older than 6 months who suffer from insomnia or other significant sleep problems. The experts working in these facilities would certainly agree that there are children who suffer from insomnia. However, they don\\'t always agree on what qualifies for the diagnosis.  Most people think of insomnia as night after night of sleeplessness, followed by a string of bleary-eyed days. But insomnia simply means sleeplessness -- even for just one night. All children, at some point, will have trouble sleeping, whether it\\'s because they watched a scary show earlier in the day, haven\\'t established a regular bedtime routine, or are simply excited about the next day\\'s events. Of course, one or two bad nights wouldn\\'t merit a trip to a sleep center.  Some experts consider a sleep difficulty to be significant when it takes someone more than 30 minutes to fall asleep on three nights a week for at least three months. But most pediatric sleep experts use looser criteria for diagnosing insomnia in kids, focusing mostly on whether the sleep issues cause problems during waking hours for either the child or his parents. The more nights of disrupted sleep that a child experiences, the more likely he\\'ll be to develop a habit of enduring sleeplessness, explains Parents advisor Jodi Mindell, Ph.D., associate director of the Sleep Center at The Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia. Your child isn\\'t likely to outgrow a bout of sleeplessness that lasts more than three or four weeks, she says. That\\'s because every time he goes to sleep, he\\'s developing his sleep behavior. The longer he has difficulty falling asleep, the higher the likelihood that he is unwittingly teaching himself not to sleep. But, she adds, \"You can always solve a sleep problem. It\\'s never too late.\" ', \" Sleep specialists say there are two main types of insomnia in kids. Sleep-onset-association insomnia is more likely to be seen in children younger than 5 and usually involves interruptions in sleep during the night. All children naturally wake ten to 12 times during the night and most roll over and fall back asleep, explains Daniel Glaze, M.D., medical director of Texas Children's Hospital Sleep Center, in Houston. But a child who's used to having a parent help him fall asleep could cry out until she appears.  Limit-setting insomnia, on the other hand, is mostly seen in children older than 5, who are able to get out of bed. A child with this issue makes prolonged bedtime curtain calls -- asking for water, claiming there's a scary monster under the bed, or suddenly needing an explanation of what happens when the toilet flushes. When his parent gets him a drink or tries to discuss his fears, it only reinforces his behavior. \", \" When children don't get enough sleep (12 to 14 hours total for toddlers; 11 to 13 hours for preschoolers) they can have a drop in IQ points equivalent to what's typically seen in a child who has lead poisoning, according to a study from the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville. And if sleep problems persist for many years, they can impair a child's ability to complete tasks that require a higher level of thinking later in life, according to researchers at the University of Colorado, in Boulder, who tracked the sleep habits of twins.  It's not exactly clear why a child's brain is affected when she loses sleep, but studies suggest that a sleep deficit causes neurons to lose their ability to adapt, says Judith Owens, M.D., a Parents advisor and director of sleep medicine at Children's National Medical Center, in Washington, D.C. In other words, a tired brain becomes incapable of forming the connections needed to embed new knowledge, memories, and skills. One study found that elementary-school students who had missed just one hour of sleep three nights in a row performed two years below their actual grade level on academic tests.  What's more, a growing body of evidence is turning up proof that insufficient sleep is one of the culprits behind the childhood obesity epidemic, most likely because sleep plays a crucial role in regulating the hormones that determine appetite. In one large Canadian study, children between the ages of 2 and 6 who got less than ten hours of shut-eye a night were more than four times more likely to be overweight or obese than kids who consistently got 11 hours of sleep a night. Research in adults also suggests that there may be long-term cardiovascular risks from a lack of sleep, which Dr. Owens says could mean similar trouble in children.  The number of children at risk for these side effects is probably greater than the estimated 20 to 30 percent of kids suffering from insomnia, says Sarah Honaker, Ph.D., a behavioral sleep specialist at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. After all, a parent is better able to recognize when she's tired than when her own child is tired. And fatigued kids often become hyperactive, making it even harder to recognize the real problem. \", ' Dr. Mindell says that even when parents are aware of a child\\'s sleep deficit, they don\\'t always seek out help. I, for one, did not go to my pediatrician to discuss my son\\'s bad bedtime behavior -- and that 3:45 A.M. wake-up call was certainly not the first time we\\'d had sleep issues in our house. As a working mom, I\\'ve often felt guilty when I don\\'t see my children during the day, so I lie in bed with them for at least an hour every night, rubbing their backs until they fall asleep. I knew my children\\'s sleep snafus were a monster of my own making and I saw no need to tattle on myself to their doctor.  As it turns out, the pediatrician is the first person any parent should turn to when sleep problems arise. Insomnia is a symptom that may signal the possibility of another problem, say Drs. Mindell and Owens, who together wrote the book Take Charge of Your Child\\'s Sleep. This could be a mental-health issue, such as ADHD, anxiety, depression, or autism, or a medical condition like reflux, restless legs syndrome, or sleep apnea. After your doctor has ruled out other causes, your child may need a consultation with a sleep expert and possibly even an overnight sleep study.  Most of the time, though, the cause is what sleep specialists call \"behavioral\" and what my guilty conscience calls \"my fault.\" Fortunately, experts are more than willing to cut parents some slack: Some children have a predisposition to have sleep problems or a tendency to worry. Although parents can contribute to the problem, they can also be a part of the solution. On the next pages are the most common reasons why kids don\\'t go to sleep and strategies you can try tonight. ', \" Play games during the daytime that will make your child more comfortable when the lights are out, suggests Dr. Honaker. For example, give her a flashlight and let her hunt for a few stuffed animals in her room. You can go with her the first couple of times, but then coax her to go it alone as she becomes more comfortable. If she asks to sleep with the light on, try to resist. It's okay to use a night-light, but bright lights can interfere with the release of the sleep-regulating natural hormone melatonin. \", \" Put a stop to repeat runs to the bathroom and requests for water by creating bedtime passes, explains Dr. Owens. Studies conducted on 3- to 10-year-olds prove that this technique delivers. Give your child two passes: one for a hug and another for a bathroom break or a drink. Tell him he can use the passes after lights-out, but after that, he can't get out of his bed. Praise him for using the passes, but put him back to bed with little emotion if he gets out of bed sans pass. When he doesn't use both of his passes, he can trade them in for a reward the next day. \", \" If your child requires extra attention at night, or even just the presence of a parent to find her way to la-la land, Dr. Glaze recommends a technique called extinction -- as in, make her need for you at nighttime extinct. This is more of a cold-turkey approach, where you explain to your child that you love her and want her to get a good night's rest, but then you close the door and ignore any shouts. (It's helpful to turn off the monitor if you still have one.) Alternatively, you could slowly move out of her room over a period of several nights. Start out by sitting on your child's bed, then sit on the floor by the bed the next few nights, then on the floor close to the door, and finally walk out the door. \", \" For a child who's still awake for 30 minutes or more after you put him to bed, Dr. Honaker suggests a technique called bedtime fading. First track what time he's actually falling asleep by making frequent post-bedtime checks for two weeks. Then use the latest time -- say it's 9:30 P.M. -- as his bedtime for the next few nights. When he begins falling asleep soon after getting into bed, start moving closer to his ideal bedtime. The theory behind this: All the time he's spent tossing and turning has probably caused your child to associate the fruitless behavior with his bed. Being ready to fall asleep shortly after climbing under his sheets should help him connect his bed to the idea of a peaceful slumber. \", \" If your little one generally has a tough time winding down at bedtime, try an infusion of the mundane. This means no screen time near the end of the day. Elisa Nebolsine, a children's cognitive behavioral therapist in McLean, Virginia, says a kid's body and mind need to be relaxed -- even bored -- in order for them to fall asleep. Try tricks like having your child count backwards from ten (or 20) over and over to help her zone out. Or read her a picture book that is a little too young for her (one she knows by heart); she may find the familiarity and repetition soothing. \", \" It's tempting to just scooch over when your child wants to get into bed with you. But stay strong and walk him back to his room. And if he tends to climb in while you're sound asleep, Dr. Mindell suggests attaching a bell to your child's doorknob or yours. When you hear it ring, get up and quickly and quietly escort him back to his room.

Here's how to help your youngster settle back to sleep.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  All of us go through different stages during sleep, from drowsiness to light sleep and from there into a deeper sleep. In REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep, we dream. If you watch your 1-year-old as she sleeps, you may be able to see the movement of her eyes under her closed lids as she dreams. By age 1, your little one has been dreaming for a long time and probably has four or five dreams each night. Most children do not have trouble with nightmares until about age 3, but you may find that your child wakes at night from time to time from what seems to have been a bad dream.  What happens during a child's waking hours affects his sleep, making him more or less tired or stimulated and giving him material for dreams in the night that lies ahead. The separation fears that normally accompany advances in gross motor development may trigger some problems at night. You may find that your child has trouble letting you go at bedtime or that he calls you in the middle of the night more often than he used to. One-year-olds often develop new fears -- of animals, for instance, or loud noises -- and these can affect his sleeping habits, as can the overstimulation that often accompanies a 1-year-old's new experiences. At times like these, a little reassurance that you love him and that you are nearby is usually all your child really needs to calm himself down and go back to sleep on his own.  Your child will spend approximately one-third of her life asleep. With all of that sack time ahead of her, it is important to teach her to be a self-reliant, even confident, sleeper. Trusting her to go to sleep on her own without having you there every minute, while being nearby to provide comfort, reassurance, and support when she wakes up in the middle of the night and needs it, should help your child-and you-to make it through the night peacefully.

Check out these expert-approved guidelines on creating better bedtimes by age.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Up to 50% of children experience a sleep problem, according to a study published in American Family Physician. Though there are sometimes biological explanations for disrupted sleep, \"the vast majority of sleep problems are caused by parents unintentionally not allowing children to get the sleep they need,\" asserts Marc Weissbluth, M.D., author of Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child and an associate professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University Medical School. \"There are too many activities—both parents\\' and child\\'s—that interfere with an early bedtime.\"  Other experts point out that many children, having been rocked or nursed to sleep (or allowed to fall asleep in their parents\\' beds) since birth, have simply never learned to fall asleep on their own.  It\\'s important to develop good sleep hygiene early. That\\'s because proper night\\'s rest is crucial for children\\'s healthy growth, immune function, and behavior. Exhausted kids are more likely to be cranky, impatient, and do poorly in school.  Most experts agree that the earlier you start developing a solid sleep schedule, the easier it is to establish healthy nighttime habits in your children. Here\\'s a parent\\'s guide to creating better bedtimes by age, ranging from the newborn phase to age 11. ', ' Newborns sleep about 16 to 17 hours a day. They slip between the waking and sleeping states with little regard for day or night, typically feeding every two to four hours. A more regular sleep cycle begins to emerge around 6 to 8 weeks, in which the baby sleeps more at night and stays awake during the day. Making sure that your infant is exposed to sunlight during the day and kept in a darkened room at night establishes this pattern. ', ' By 3 or 4 months, babies\\' sleep cycles begin to vaguely resemble those of adults, passing through cycles of active sleep (REM, or rapid eye movement) and deep sleep. Both stages are critical to development. \"We know that the human growth hormone is released during deep sleep, so children require this stage of sleep to grow,\" notes Paul Saskin, clinical director of the Regional Center for Sleep Disorders at Sunrise Hospital, in Las Vegas. \"And it is thought that REM is needed for learning and memory. Like a computer backing up its hard drive, the brain is organizing its filing system.\"  By 4 months, total sleep decreases to about 15 hours, the longest sleep period (which, with luck, occurs at night) stretches from about four to nine hours, and midmorning and midafternoon naps develop. At this point, parents can start reinforcing their child\\'s biological rhythms by anticipating their baby\\'s natural sleepiness, soothing them, and putting them down to sleep before they get overtired, says Dr. Weissbluth. \"Helping your child fall asleep is like surfing: You want to catch the wave of drowsiness as it\\'s rising, before your baby crashes into an overtired state,\" he explains. A good rule of thumb is to put your baby down to sleep every two hours. ', ' As their baby approaches 6 months of age, \"parents often ask, \\'Why is my child still waking up three and four times a night?\\'\" says Mark D. Widome, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, in Hershey. \"Instead, they should be asking, \\'Why does my child need my help to get back to sleep when he wakes up?\\'\"  Indeed, researchers at McGill University, in Montreal, videotaped a group of infants and found that all woke up an average of four times a night. Many, however, did not call out but managed to soothe themselves back to sleep (the so-called good sleepers). Those described as problem sleepers tended to cry out and make their awakenings known.  \"By 5 or 6 months, if a healthy child is waking up at night for feedings, it\\'s a learned behavior,\" says Dr. Widome. \"Don\\'t be so quick to take her out of bed and feed her. If you do, you\\'re not giving her ample opportunity to try to get back to sleep herself.\" Keep in mind, too, that the more often you put your baby to bed when they\\'re still awake, the more practice they\\'ll get soothing themselves to sleep. ', ' Some parents are surprised to find that around 8 or 9 months, their baby, who had been sleeping through the night, suddenly begins to wake in the middle of the night and cry for them. \"They\\'re at that developmental stage when they are starting to understand object permanence,\" explains Claire Lerner, a child-development specialist at Zero To Three, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting healthy development in the first three years of life. \"They are beginning to understand that you exist out there even though they can\\'t see you, so, naturally, they call for you.\"  Whether your child has regressed or has never quite mastered the skill of going to sleep solo, try choosing a sleep training method that works for your family, and implementing it for your child. Some options include the cry it out method, the fading method, the pick-up, put-down method, and the Ferber method. \"Don\\'t start any kind of sleep training until you are committed to following through—if you let your baby cry one night and then go to him the next, it may worsen the problem,\" says Lerner. ', ' By 18 months, most babies have given up their morning nap; at 3, some will be ready to give up their afternoon nap as well. At this stage, there is so much excitement in a toddler\\'s life that they can\\'t wind down at night, even when they\\'re exhausted. If you find that your toddler has a cranky period toward the end of the day, it may be a sign that they need to go to sleep earlier. \"Well-rested children don\\'t behave like that,\" notes Dr. Weissbluth.  Children often wind up in your bed at this age as a result of two major developmental milestones: Instead of just crying, they can now actually call out \"Mommy\" or \"Daddy,\" which is a lot harder to ignore; and the move into a big-kid bed means they don\\'t even need to call—they can just show up at your bedside. ', ' Nightmares and night terrors, which usually strike preschoolers, are common causes of night disturbance and resistance to bedtime at this age. \"Nightmares are scary to kids, but night terrors are scarier to parents,\" says Dr. Widome. Children do not even remember having had night terrors, which are a partial arousal from deep sleep usually occurring within the first couple of hours after your child goes to sleep. They might sit up and scream, but they\\'re not awake and not conscious that you\\'re there. Night terrors tend to occur when your child is overtired, according to Dr. Widome. If your kid experiences them repeatedly, taking a very short nap in the late afternoon can reduce fatigue.  Nightmares, on the other hand, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the night during REM sleep. Bad dreams are young children\\'s way of playing out unresolved feelings or experiences, says Claire Lerner. Since they cannot yet distinguish between fantasy and reality, the scary feelings remain. In addition to providing comfort, help your child figure out ways to combat their fears.  Nightmares aside, if your preschooler is still waking up at night, you might want to consider using a system of rewards and consequences. Dr. Weissbluth recommends providing a set of sleep rules (close your eyes; stay quiet; stay in bed; try to sleep). For every night that they follow the sleep rules, the child earns a star. When they accumulate a certain number of stars, they receive a reward. When they don\\'t follow the rules, they lose a privilege the next day. ', ' Insufficient sleep is the most insidious sleep problem among older children. They\\'re going to sleep later yet waking up at the same time. A growing body of research suggests that sleep deprivation has a significant impact on school behavior and performance. \"Instead of becoming quiet and somnolent, as adults do, kids become hyperactive and out of control,\" says David Gozal, M.D., director of the Comprehensive Sleep Medicine Center at Tulane University Hospital Clinics, in New Orleans. \"Their ability to pay attention decreases, as does their ability to concentrate, solve problems, and retain what they learn.\"  Experts agree that parents must set limits, not only on how late school-age kids can stay up but on what they can do before bedtime. Watching TV, playing computer and video games, and using a phone or iPad are stimulating activities that keep kids\\' minds working overtime. And a full plate of after-school commitments prevents them from finishing their homework at a reasonable hour. \"Families need to make sleep a priority and put it into their schedules,\" says sleep expert Mary Carskadon, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University. Sleep should not be a last resort after activities—or energy—run out.  If your child is still having difficulty falling asleep from the start of bedtime, speak with their health care provider about possible factors that are negatively impacting their sleep and possible solutions.

', ' For children who don’t like separation, the daily drop-off can be challenging. Follow these tips for easing school anxiety in daycare, preschool, and the elementary years.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  \"I don\\'t want to go to school!\" It\\'s an age-old complaint from children, but a growing body of research suggests that it can signal a deeper problem: school anxiety. This fear affects 2 to 5% of school-age children, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). And the pandemic certainly didn\\'t made things easier, with disruptions to routine, perhaps more time at home with caregivers, and an undercurrent of fear for both children and adults.  It\\'s no mystery why kids may have anxiety going to school, but how do you know whether your child\\'s protests are a ploy to avoid an uncomfortable situation or a genuine cry for help? Read on for more about the causes and symptoms of school anxiety, with tips for making drop-off easier. ', \" If you're dealing with anxiety, tears, and fears at daycare drop-off, it can be incredibly challenging to deal with—and set your entire day off with stress. Here are some things to know about what might be behind the tears at dropoff and how to cope. \", \" Around 8 months, many children develop separation anxiety, which causes them to scream and cry whenever their caregiver isn't around. This anxiety coincides with a new intellectual skill called object permanence: the ability to remember objects and specific people that aren't present, according to pediatrician Alan Greene, M.D., FAAP. In other words, your baby starts calling up mental pictures of you when you aren't there—and they miss your warmth, comfort, and familiarity. Young children also don't have a sense of time, so they don't understand whether you'll be gone for an hour or two days. \", \" Babies and toddlers may scream and cling during drop-off—but they'll usually stop once you're out of sight. \", ' Dr. Greene suggests preparing your child with \"separation\" games, such as peek-a-boo, which reinforce that you\\'ll always return after leaving. You can also begin introducing small doses of separation into your little one\\'s life—a visit to an aunt\\'s house or a day with a grandparent. According to Elizabeth Berger, M.D., a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \"Little by little, your child will become more comfortable with spending time away with you, because she knows that you will return when you said that you would and because she had a good time even when you were gone.\"  When it\\'s time for daycare drop-off, \"goodbyes should be brief, affectionate, and with a clear statement that you will be back,\" Dr. Greene says. Don\\'t draw out the leaving process, since it can make the experience more traumatic for a child. Also avoid sneaking out without saying goodbye; your little one might feel that they can\\'t trust you. In some cases, switching up the caregiver who does drop-off might help. (For instance, my daughter clings to my neck and cries when I drop her off, but happily waves to my husband without a glance back.) Finally, Dr. Greene suggests bringing a stuffed animal, blanket, or other comforting object to the daycare center. ', ' You might have imagined that preschool would be thrilling for your child—only to deal with a lot of resistance. The good news is, this can be normal and there are some steps that might help. ', ' \"School\" is an abstract concept to a kid who\\'s never been before. The unfamiliar people and routines can be scary for them. Some preschoolers might also have lingering separation anxiety, but this is completely normal—it simply means that a child has a strong attachment to a caregiver. ', ' Usually, kids with school anxiety will show a range of stress- or anxiety-related symptoms. Preschoolers might talk about their fear of school and ask for repeated reassurance: \"Can you stay at school with me?\" \"Do I have to go?\" They may also complain about stomachaches or headaches, or they\\'ll throw tantrums when you\\'re ready to leave. ', \" If your child is going into preschool, take them on a tour a few days beforehand, recommends Sucheta Connolly, M.D., a child psychiatrist and director of the Pediatric Stress and Anxiety Disorders Clinic at the University of Illinois in Chicago, which treats children as young as 2. Talk openly and excitedly to your child about their upcoming routine. If they tend to have trouble with new social situations, arrange for playdates with some new classmates before school begins.  Also consider role-playing at home. Many children are cognitively ready for school but struggle to assert themselves socially. Use puppets, dolls, or stuffed animals to act out social situations that make them anxious, such as meeting the teacher for the first time.  When the first day comes, it's sometimes best to tell your child that you will stay for a few minutes to help them feel settled. Give them a little memento to put in their pocket that reminds them of you, so they can take it out if they feel sad. If you think the problem is serious, you might speak privately with the teacher. Many children are a bit weepy at first, but most of them cheer up in a few minutes.  You can also reward children for taking positive steps toward independence. For example, put a sticker on your kid's chart every day they attend school without tears or clinging, and when they earn a certain number of stickers, take them on a special outing. \", ' Just when you think your child may be getting comfortable leaving you, a new anxiety sets in. What gives? Separation anxiety at school can set in even if your child has had no problem leaving before. ', ' School anxiety in elementary students has many different causes. For starters, the child might be stressed by the demands of the classroom. \"Our society is expecting more and more from our kids at younger ages,\" says Dr. Connolly. \"And not all of them can handle it.\"  Along those lines, the student may have undiagnosed learning disability, adds Dr. Connolly. If they have difficulty with a certain subject—but the teachers aren\\'t aware or think the student simply isn\\'t trying—the kid can fret about school.  Other factors, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and social anxiety, can also make school seem scary. Children with GAD suffer excessive worry about everyday things—academic performance, being away from parents, etc. Kids with social anxiety often feel intensely scrutinized and worry that they\\'ll do something embarrassing. Some are fearful of speaking in front of the class, while others have trouble even walking up to the blackboard. ', \" Children might have physical symptoms (headaches, nausea, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, etc.) that appear before the school day, according to the ADAA. Some will develop school refusal—a fear so intense that they can't be coaxed into the school bus or the building. If they manage to get to school, they may cry, complain of aches and pains, and can't be consoled by the teacher.  It's important to note that children with school anxiety struggle every day of school. It's not something they have one day but not the next. \", \" Always have recurrent physical symptoms checked out by a pediatrician to rule out medical problems. But assuming kids are physically healthy, try to explore their feelings and emotion together. Acknowledge that they feel scared, but reiterate that nervousness doesn't mean they won't enjoy themselves. Remind them of new situations they've dealt with, such as sleeping at Grandma's house for the first time without you, and how it ended up fine.  It's also important to rule out problems at school or home. Ask your child and their teacher if something upsetting happened, such as bullying or teasing. Events at home—a move, a divorce, the death of a family pet, etc.—might also be causing these negative feelings. Dealing with these issues accordingly might relieve some negative symptoms.  If the school anxiety doesn't ease for several weeks, or if it affects your child's everyday life, have them evaluated by a mental health professional who specializes in working with kids. School anxiety is not a psychiatric diagnosis, but it may be a symptom of an anxiety disorder. Treatment usually begins with cognitive behavioral therapy, which teaches relaxation and coping skills and can result in improved behavior over several months. Doctors may also prescribe medication for severe cases. Work with the expert and your child's teacher to help your child feel more comfortable in the classroom.

They may be experiencing separation anxiety. Learn how to identify the signs and help your little one feel comfortable without you.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Illustration by Dennis Madamba for Parents  If goodbyes with your toddler are full of screams and tears, your little one might be experiencing separation anxiety. \"As children begin walking, they assert their independence and move away from their parents. But they\\'re not ready to fully separate,\" says psychotherapist Fran Walfish, Psy.D., author of The Self-Aware Parent.  Toddlers may act like they can do everything themselves, but as soon as you leave, they want to be back by your side since they crave the familiarity and security you provide. But knowing that the behavior is normal doesn\\'t make it easy—for either of you.  Read on to learn more about separation anxiety in toddlers, with tips on easing your child\\'s worries (or your own). ', ' Whether you\\'re dropping your child off at daycare or leaving them at home with Grandma, farewells can be tough. By the time they\\'re able to walk, children understand object permanence—the idea that something (or someone) continues to exist even when it can\\'t be seen or heard.  But toddlers can\\'t yet comprehend the concept of time. Leaving them in a bedroom for a few minutes or with a babysitter for a few hours feels like the same amount of time for them. This can be scary since toddlers believe their survival is dependent on having a primary caregiver nearby.  In a strange way, the fact that they are so concerned is a good thing. \"Somewhat ironically, anxiety can be a sign of a child\\'s increasing autonomy,\" says Miranda Goodman-Wilson, Ph.D., a content editor at the American Institutes for Research, which conducts research on behavioral and social science. \"They have their own opinion on the situation—that parents shouldn\\'t leave—and want to exert control.\" ', ' The following scenarios might trigger separation anxiety in your little ones. ', \" Toddlers are working to develop more mastery over their bodies (think running and self-feeding), and every new challenge they face can cause stress, Dr. Walfish notes. As a result, they can feel conflicted about being away from the security of their primary caregivers. Toddlers need reassurance that when you leave, you'll always come back. \", ' Going to a large gathering can be particularly anxiety-provoking for your toddler, who may be afraid of losing you in a crowd. ', ' Leaving your toddler in their room at night or for a nap can inspire anxiety since naptime and nighttime are probably the longest stretches of alone time they regularly experience. ', ' Separation anxiety is \"typically most prevalent between 8 and 18 months,\" says Erin Boyd-Soisson, Ph.D., a professor of human development and family science at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.  When a caregiver departs, a child may cling, throw a tantrum, or resist other caregivers in an attempt to convince the parent not to leave. They may also show signs of fear and restlessness when their parent goes into another room, drops them off at daycare, or leaves them alone at bedtime.  The outbursts usually subside once the caregiver is out of view. \"This anxiety serves to keep the child close to the caregiver, who is their source of love and safety,\" Dr. Boyd-Soisson says. ', ' Separation anxiety tends to decrease as a child gets older, but similar feelings may return for short periods of time for other reasons. \"When older toddlers or preschoolers are sick or stressed, separation anxiety can be triggered again,\" says Dr. Boyd-Soisson.  \"For example, most 2-year-olds who have been in daycare for a while are often fine when their parents leave. However, when they are starting to get sick, or if they are under stress, it is not uncommon for them to cling to their parents at drop-off,\" she adds.  This behavior is a normal part of child development and will ease and fade away over time. Every child is unique, however, so there is no set period during which separation anxiety will begin or end. At times it may take a few months for a toddler\\'s anxiety to dissipate, so be prepared for regression, especially when routines change because of vacation, illness, or a move. ', \" Although it may be difficult to hear your child cry, remember that separation anxiety does have a positive aspect: It indicates that a healthy attachment has formed between a caregiver and a child. While separation anxiety in toddlers isn't something to worry about, do watch for signs of extreme anxiety, says Julia F. Heberle, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania.  In a small number of cases, children beyond the age of toddlerhood will develop separation anxiety disorder. Dr. Heberle recommends analyzing the situation surrounding your child's feelings. Is there parental conflict, divorce, or something wrong with the child care setting? If so, separation anxiety may be amplified. (A family history of anxiety may also play a role.) If your child shows excessive symptoms, such as vomiting, nightmares, or unrelenting worry, contact your pediatrician. \", \" Separation anxiety in toddlers may last months or years, but there's plenty you can do to ease the symptoms. Follow these tips to help banish your child's worries. \", ' Whenever you leave your child, give them advance warning that a babysitter will be arriving or that you\\'ll be dropping them off, then say a quick goodbye. \"If you act anxious, or keep returning for another hug, they will think there is something to worry about,\" says Vincent Barone, Ph.D., a child psychologist at Children\\'s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri.  Though you may be tempted, avoid sneaking out while your toddler is distracted, which can cause them to worry that you might disappear without warning—and result in more clinginess. Try to convey that the time apart is temporary and not cause for alarm. ', ' It can help to develop a very brief routine for the process. You might say, \"I will be back to get you after work. I love you.\" Then hug your child and leave. By keeping farewells the same each time, you create a familiar transition from being with you to being without you. ', \" Ask your sitter, daycare teacher, or other caregiver to have an activity ready as soon as you hand your toddler over. Getting children engaged in a clapping game or new toy takes their mind off the fact that you're leaving, says Elizabeth Pantley, author of The No-Cry Separation Anxiety Solution. \", ' Be sure to acknowledge your toddler\\'s separation anxiety, says Donna Holloran, owner of Babygroup, Inc., in Santa Monica, California. You could say, \"I know you\\'re going to have a really good time with Grandma, but it\\'s OK if you miss me. You can tell Grandma you miss me, and I bet Grandma will give you a really big hug.\" ', ' When you arrive someplace with a lot of faces, avoid pushing your toddler to interact without you. Instead, wait until they take an interest in others—but don\\'t wander off and disappear. \"They might accept being held by someone, but only minutes later decide that it\\'s too much,\" says Pantley.  Be ready to scoop your child up if they get upset; pushing them beyond their limits will only make the next group situation more difficult. And don\\'t stress if you have to stay by your toddler\\'s side the whole time. \"You\\'re not crippling them—you\\'re offering support, which will help them feel comfortable in future social settings,\" says Dr. Walfish. ', ' Establish a relaxing nighttime ritual, such as a bath followed by a favorite storybook or songs. This will help your toddler adjust to the fact that bedtime (and alone time) is approaching. Give them a lovey to hold and turn on some soothing sounds, like soft white noise or a recording of ocean waves. It will make the quiet in their room less obvious when you leave, says Pantley. ', ' If your toddler wakes up from a nap and is happily playing in their crib, don\\'t rush in to get them. \"Let your child have the chance to experience what it feels like to be by themselves and have a good time,\" suggests Pantley. Finding that they\\'re comfortable with it will boost their confidence and independence, and ultimately help them feel more secure on their own. ', \" Give children an item to hold whenever they're away from their parents; it can be something they pick out themselves that reminds them of home and family (a special picture in a frame, a stuffed animal, etc.) It's important that the child has access to this item whenever needed and it's not under the control of the adults in charge. This way, the child can use it as a soothing tool when they're feeling separation anxiety. \", ' Another idea is watching developmentally appropriate children’s TV shows that cover separation anxiety (one example is the \"Grown Ups Come Back\" episode of Daniel Tiger\\'s Neighborhood). That\\'s because kids are often visual learners, and they might relate to the simple stories and the songs, helping them feel less alone. ', \" Children’s literature helps with social-emotional learning, and it also presents kids with relatable situations. Consider reading The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn, in which a small raccoon who is scared to be away from its mother realizes she has never-ending love, no matter if they're together or apart.

Find out how to overcome separation anxiety for a happier first day of school.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Although starting preschool is a major milestone, it often comes with lots of crying, uncertainty, and heel digging. \"For children, the main source of anxiety around entering preschool is that they have absolutely no idea what to expect,\" says Katrina Green, a certified early childhood and early childhood special education teacher at the Just Wee Two program in Brooklyn, New York. \"They have spent the first three to four years learning the rules and routines of their family life and they are completely unfamiliar with the new rules and routines they will encounter.\"  Since starting preschool is such a novel experience, you shouldn\\'t treat it like any other date on your calendar. \"Take several weeks before the first day to ease [them] into this new adventure,\" says Alisa Clark Ackerman, who has taught at several preschools in New York City. Read on to learn the best ways to help a child with \"first day of preschool\" separation anxiety. ', ' Preparing your child for preschool can greatly reduce any separation anxiety they may feel when you leave. Here are some ways to familiarize your youngster with their new environment.  Explain the routines of preschool. Tell them about the games they\\'ll play, the kids they\\'ll meet, and how you\\'ll always be there to pick them up at the end of the day. Don\\'t overhype school, and don\\'t make promises about things you can\\'t control (like making new friends). If your child\\'s initial experience doesn\\'t match their expectations, school may already seem scary, not exciting.  Meet the teacher. Many preschools host an open house, where parents, teachers, and children can get to know each other. There will likely be many parents vying for the teacher\\'s attention, but make sure you get a chance to chat with them when your child is within earshot. \"If you show your child that the teacher is someone you like and trust, he\\'ll have an easier time forming an attachment to her,\" says Ackerman.  Visit the school. Before the school year, take your child around the classroom and point out the different activities they\\'ll do each day. Also tell them the name of the school, recommends Ackerman. \"Over the first week or so leading up to preschool, prepare him for the first day by saying, \\'Next week you\\'ll go to Elm Street Preschool and play with the tambourine,\\'\" she says. What\\'s more, whenever you\\'re driving by the school, casually point it out to your child, suggests Parents adviser Kathleen McCartney, Ph.D., a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education.  Set up playdates before the school year. Seeing familiar faces in their class will increase your child\\'s comfort level. You\\'ll get a class list during the summer, \"so plan playdates with some other classmates before the big day,\" says Amy Flynn, director of the Bank Street Family Center at the Bank Street College of Education in New York City, which trains teachers from around the country. \"Also, ask about setting up a buddy system; you and another class family have each other as contacts for playdates and support before school begins.  Keep a positive mindset. Your child will take cues from you, so be calm and confident that everything will go well. You don\\'t want to ask them if they\\'re scared too many times—that might make them even more fearful, says Flynn. But if they seem anxious in the days preceding school, reassure them that everything will be OK and that you\\'re nearby if they need you.  Role play. Pretend play with stuffed animals can help your child adjust to the idea that they\\'ll be leaving you, but you\\'ll come back. (For example, their teddy bear goes to school with some other furry friends, and Mommy Teddy leaves and returns after they\\'ve sung a song and had a snack).  Read books. \"Books that describe what happens at school, as well as validate a child\\'s feelings, can help quell jitters,\" says Sally Tannen, director of the Parenting Center at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, which has its own preschool. These books provide your child with a sort of dry run of school in the comfort of home, where they feel safe. ', ' No matter how much you prepare, your preschooler will still be full of nerves on their first day. Here\\'s how to make drop-off a little easier.  Create a goodbye ritual. Having a goodbye routine provides comfort and familiarity, so your child knows what\\'s to come. This could be anything you and your child decide on, such as a special hug or handshake followed by a \"See you later, alligator!\" Once you\\'ve said your goodbyes, it\\'s best to skedaddle so that your child doesn\\'t become preoccupied by your presence. A long farewell scene might only serve to reinforce a child\\'s sense that preschool is a bad place.  Don\\'t sneak away. That said, some little ones will feel more afraid if you suddenly disappear. Parents should never be ripped away abruptly from their child, says Fran Walfish, Psy.D., child and family psychotherapist and the author of The Self-Aware Parent. It can take up to ten weeks for a child to fully be ready to be left at school without their parent. The best way to handle the separation process is having the parent go to school and sit next to their child. They should not interact with them in games and toys, but rather be there as a safety net.  Bring a comforting object. Have your child bring a little reminder of home to ease their separation anxiety. If they don\\'t have a favorite doll or blankie, even a beloved book or a sippy cup filled with their favorite drink can do the trick. Comfort objects may seem like small stuff to you, but they can provide a real sense of security to kids in an unfamiliar environment.  Never make comparisons. Don\\'t chastise your toddler and say, \"Nolan doesn\\'t cry when his mom leaves.\" Honoring your child\\'s process is the best way to make the transition to preschool as smooth as possible, Green says. \"The child who never cries when his parent leaves him may act out the scene over and over again during play to process his feelings. Another child may need to cry at every separation for a while in order to work through his feelings,\" Green says.  Remind them that you came back. When you pick them up at the end of the day, reinforce the idea that you came back, just like you said you would. This way, each day\\'s drop-off won\\'t feel like you\\'re both starting teary and upsetting goodbyes all over again.  Consider a reward system. Linda Roos, of Scottsdale, Arizona, gave her kindergartner his own calendar. If he went to class without putting up a fuss, she put a smiley face on the calendar (otherwise, he got a sad face). On Friday, if he had five smiley faces, she made him a treasure hunt as a treat. ', ' Don\\'t minimize the importance of easing your fears as well as your child\\'s. If you feel guilty or worried about leaving them at school, your child will probably sense that. The more calm and assured you are, the more confident your child will be.  Get to know the teacher beforehand. Your child can benefit from meeting their teacher before school—but so can you. Ask your child\\'s teacher what their procedure is when children are crying for their parents. Make sure a school staff member is ready to help your child with the transfer from your care to the classroom.  What\\'s more, \"it\\'s helpful for me to know as much as possible about a child\\'s home life in order to ease their transition into preschool,\" says Green. \"Their eating, sleeping, and toileting patterns are just as important as knowing their favorite color, what games they like to play, or what songs they like to sing. It also helps to know what techniques the family uses to calm a child down when she is feeling upset or anxious (so I can) try to replicate those techniques in the classroom.\" Be sure to let the teacher know about any medical issues, such as food allergies.  Think of preschool as a life lesson. Many parents may see their child have a bad first reaction to preschool and immediately decide to pull them out of the classroom. But that\\'s a bad idea: \"It denies the child an opportunity to learn how to work through negative feelings and sets a precedent of not having to face problems,\" Green says.  Resist surprise visits Once you\\'ve left your child, resist the temptation to go back and check on them, and don\\'t phone the school every hour. \"If you\\'re always checking up on your child, you risk the reciprocity of your child checking on you constantly,\" says Dr. Walfish.  Give yourself a pep talk.  Come up with a mantra such as, \"This is best place for (your child\\'s name)\" or \"Bringing (your child\\'s name) here is the right decision\" to remind you of why being apart is good for both you and your child. Then, keep repeating it as often as you need it!  Have patience with your preschooler. It\\'s OK to keep leaving the child if they keep crying, Green says. \"A complete and successful transition into school can take months, especially if there are family vacations or breaks from school, when children often regress, or if there are changes happening at home.\" But rest assured that in all her years of teaching, Green hasn\\'t encountered one student who couldn\\'t overcome their separation anxiety.

', \" While our toddlers' brains are under construction to gain more control over their anger, Parents Ask Your Mom expert Emily Edlynn, Ph.D., says we can help in two critical areas: co-regulation and communicating that we are comfortable with anger as long as everyone stays safe.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email \", ' When my 3-and-half-year-old gets mad, she looks at you with squinted eyes, clenched teeth, and sometimes growls. It\\'s evident she is very angry, and seems to get angry quite often when she doesn\\'t get her way or is told no. Before, she would hit and kick. I was able to get her away from doing that by allowing her to use her expressions to show anger, but now we are here. What is the best way to help her express her anger in a healthy way?  I am going to re-frame your situation: your 3-year-old shows self-control and progress that you both should be proud of! Your work with her has clearly paid off. At her age, growling with an angry face is expressing anger in a healthy way because no people or property are harmed in the process. I suggest switching up the question: \"How do I keep helping her express anger in healthy ways?\" What you continue to do with her during these angry episodes matters as her brain develops emotional regulation skills with every passing day of big feelings and not getting exactly what she wants. ', \" I have noticed in my work with families, and in real life knowing anyone parenting children, that anger can be our toughest emotion to navigate. Our childhood experiences with adults expressing anger can play out with our own children. Seeing our child's anger may be an emotional trigger for those whose caregivers blew up easily, or unfamiliar territory for those whose caregivers withdrew and went silent when angry, communicating that expressing anger is not permitted. Because anger makes us uncomfortable for a range of reasons, we often convey to our children to express emotions . . . except anger. If we get more comfortable with anger as a natural human emotion, we help our children embrace their own, eventually without hurting anyone—or growling. \", \" The young child has the brain parts to feel strong emotions suddenly, but not yet the brain development to harness these emotions. In working with children in my therapy office, I start with the basics of emotions with almost every child regardless of age, like noticing how they feel in their bodies, labeling the feelings, and then articulating emotions to eventually replace exploding behaviors. In my years of therapy practice and motherhood, I can attest that young children most often do not have the ability to calmly state how they are feeling when angry. It's too complex for their brains—it means noticing, stopping a strong impulse, having insight, and then being able to put words to a highly emotional experience. (Side note: how many adults do you know who struggle with this?) \", \" There's a very important concept from child development critical for your dilemma: scaffolding. This refers to helping our children build important skills in a way that matches the skills they already have, and their readiness to level up. You have done this by helping your daughter replace destructive acts of anger with facial expressions and vocalizations that express her anger safely. It sounds like you see the next level as replacing this type of expression with behavior that feels more socially appropriate than acting like a caged animal!  Because it is probably a high bar for a 3-year-old to express anger calmly with words, I recommend focusing on two goals as the next developmental steps: physically regulating strong emotion and becoming comfortable with her anger. Mastering these coping skills ultimately dials down the intensity of anger, and will give her emotional regulation tools to last a lifetime. The great news is how much influence adults have on children this age, so you and her other caregivers can be her greatest emotional teachers. \", ' This may sound a bit fancy, but self-regulation is actually one of our most powerful strategies for emotional health: learning to calm our bodies when in distress. Regulating with your daughter, called co-regulation, helps her feel how her nervous system shifts from high alert to calm. High alert, which happens when we feel intense emotions like fear and anger, can include a racing heart, heated up body temperature, tense muscles, and rapid breathing. When my 7-year-old son—known for his big emotions—gets heated, sometimes I take his hand in mine, put it on his chest, and simply say, \"feel your heart right now.\" Toddlers and preschoolers (and some 7-year-olds) need us to regulate with them, which means we need to be regulated (aka calm). When we stay calm and offer physical comfort like hugging, sitting them on our laps, or holding hands, our calmer nervous systems help their little bodies better regulate those big emotions. ', ' The next greatest gift you can offer as a parent is modeling that anger is an acceptable emotion. We achieve this by showing that we are comfortable with our children being angry. This means avoiding two common traps: talking them out of their anger, and becoming overwhelmed by it ourselves. Our youngest children\\'s anger can look quite ridiculous on the surface, so it\\'s easy to say, \"this is so not a big deal—calm down!\" (I\\'ve done it.) When possible, however, validating \"you\\'re angry because you\\'re not getting what you want, and that is really hard\" offers empathy that goes a long way.  I\\'ve had my share of moments wanting my kids to just stop being upset, but I\\'ve learned how important it is to stick in there with the distress as often as I can, and to resort less often to shutting down the anger (my own yelling) or escaping it (tuning out with some Facebook scrolling). Just like when they are sad and you sit next to them rubbing their backs while they cry, you can show them they can feel angry and get through it: \"I see you are really angry. I\\'m here when you\\'re ready to sit in my lap.\" Note: we accept all emotions, but not all behaviors! While they are angry, we continue supporting safety. \"It\\'s fine to be angry, but not to punch me.\"  Once their bodies are calm, you can then guide dialogue about what made them angry, how it felt, and what helped it pass. This helps children practice self-awareness, identify coping strategies, and build confidence that anger passes, just like the scariest thunderstorms eventually end. ', \" With time, practice, and buckets of patience, I promise your daughter will progress beyond the angry animal stage. Accepting the emotion of anger itself while you work on expression skills at each developmental stage will prepare her well for long-term emotional health. She's fortunate to have such a wise and invested parent, even if you get angry about her anger sometimes. After all, you're both only human, and at least she knows you'll always be there for her. Even when she growls.  Submit your parenting questions here, and they may be answered in future 'Ask Your Mom' columns.

Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  When my husband Alex and I began writing our cookbook, Pretty Simple Cooking, we were a family of two. Weeks before our manuscript was due, we got the biggest surprise of our lives: our son, Larson. We adopted Larson from birth, and he is the ending to a long story of searching for our family.  For years before Larson, we\\'d been running the food blog A Couple Cooks, all about the joy of cooking and eating healthy, vegetable-forward food--together as a couple. Suddenly, we had someone new to cook for. But instead of disrupting our life with food, we found that having a baby fit right into our routine of cooking and eating real food.  Now that Larson\\'s turned one and officially a toddler, we\\'ve been able to share our greatest love with him: food! And to our surprise, it\\'s been easier than we thought…so far, at least (fingers crossed!). Here are 10 pretty simple toddler-feeding strategies that are working in our house:  Start the day with real food. Breakfast is one of the easiest meals of the day for feeding a toddler and can involve minimal \"cooking\". Think low-sugar organic yogurt, whole grain bread with peanut butter, homemade oatmeal, fruit, and eggs.  Make foods easy to eat. At age one, Larson loves food he can hold and feed himself: whole green beans (steamed from frozen), red pepper strips, roasted carrots, bananas cut into strips, pieces of whole grain bread, etc.  Make dinners the whole family can enjoy. This is our biggest advice for feeding kids. Don\\'t cook for toddlers, cook for the entire family. The Smoky Lentil Stew (see below) from Pretty Simple Cooking is a huge hit in our family.  Season to your taste, then show how much you love it. Right now, Larson is more interested in what\\'s on our plate than his. We always season his food to our tastes so it\\'s not bland \"kid food\", and then taste and show him how much we love it. Once he sees us eating it and tries it, he can be hooked into sophisticated adult food.  Make all-natural sweet treats. Our household is into naturally sweet, just-sweet-enough treats. A favorite lately is frozen yogurt dots, where we make just the filling of our all-natural strawberry yogurt pie and freeze it into small disks on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once they\\'re frozen, we peel them off and keep them in a sealable container in the freezer; Larson loves one at the end of a meal.  Smoothies are big faves. As long as the flavor is balanced and not too bitter or sweet, smoothies are a great way to load on the nutrients for kiddos.  Eggs for the win. If all else fails and Larson is not into what we\\'re eating (which does happen), he loves scrambled eggs. We\\'ll whip them up if he\\'s not into a meal.  Opt for homemade versions of kid foods. One of Larson\\'s favorite foods is fries (of course!). Instead of restaurant or frozen fries, we make homemade oven fries, hand cut potatoes with olive oil that are baked in a hot oven until crisp.  When in doubt, add flair. Not only is this simplest tomato soup delicious and vegan (made creamy using cashews), it\\'s the perfect carrier for a bit of kid flair: star toasts! Fun-shaped foods can add excitement to any meal--and honestly, for adults too.  Be patient & keep the faith. According to French Kids Eat Everything, it takes kids at least 7 times to accept a new flavor, often more. So instead of assuming Larson doesn\\'t like a type of food, we think of it more that Larson hasn\\'t tried it enough times. And we try to eat meals together as a family, but if it doesn\\'t work out on a given night, we try again tomorrow. Alex and I believe that if we continue to make real, delicious food for our toddler and eat it together, he\\'ll enjoy it in the long run. And then we don\\'t sweat the small stuff.  Smoky Red Lentil Stew  Serves 3 to 4  2 large carrots  1 medium yellow onion  2 stalks celery  3 medium garlic cloves  3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar  2 tablespoons smoked paprika (pimentón), plus more for garnish  ¼ teaspoon cumin  1/8 teaspoon cayenne  1¼ cups red lentils  1 quart (4 cups) vegetable broth  ¾ teaspoon kosher salt  Freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons lemon juice (½ large lemon)  1 handful cilantro or Italian flat-leaf parsley, for garnish  Plain Greek yogurt, for garnish (optional)  1. Peel and finely dice the carrots and onion, then finely dice the celery. Peel and mince the garlic.  2. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots and celery, and saute until the onion is translucent, about 5 to 6 minutes.  3. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute. Then stir in the balsamic vinegar, smoked paprika, cumin, cayenne, and lentils and stir for another minute. Add the broth, kosher salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Bring to a low simmer, then cover halfway and gently simmer until the lentils are just soft but before they start to break apart, about 7 to 10 minutes. Watch closely and taste to assess doneness. The finished soup should be brothy with the lentils just soft; cooking past this point yields a very thick stew (which is just as delicious but less soup-like). Stir in the lemon juice.  4. To serve, ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with torn cilantro or parsley leaves, Greek yogurt, and a sprinkle of smoked paprika.

', ' Kids are facing a mental health crisis, with separation anxiety and social anxiety on the rise. Both conditions are treatable with the proper diagnosis and support. Here\\'s what parents should know.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Anxiety is one of the most common mental health issues in children and adults. People of all ages can experience feelings of nervousness, apprehension, panic, and stress. The occurrence of anxiety-related conditions has also risen in recent years, partly thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many feel uncertain about their safety and the future, and this is particularly true among children: After living in a proverbial bubble for months and—in some cases—years, some children are struggling to cope. This has led to a rise in social anxiety and separation anxiety.  \"COVID-19 increased anxiety disorders in children globally,\" says Shannon Miller, clinical director at ChoicePoint Health. \"The sudden drastic change of learning environments and social interactions set up unusual circumstances for children\\'s developing brains. COVID disrupted children\\'s lives—and their childhood—and the psychological impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly on children and adolescents, was severe. Researchers have noted an uptick in anxiety-related issues.\"  It\\'s important not to downplay this anxiety in children. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that nearly 10 percent of children ages 3 to 17 will experience anxiety at some point, and the answer doesn\\'t lie in praying they\\'ll grow a thicker skin.  Nervous, worried kids become anxiety-prone adults, and those who haven\\'t learned coping strategies can carry these concerns with them for the rest of their lives. Apprehension about school (especially if it\\'s the first day) is understandable, but when you see your kids really struggling, it\\'s critical to ask yourselves—and them—what\\'s going on.  Here\\'s what parents need to know to support a child with separation anxiety or social anxiety. ', ' If you find yourself asking \"What is separation anxiety?\", you\\'re not alone. Separation anxiety is basically a fear of being away from parents or caregivers. It\\'s developmentally normal for children under the age of 3, who are still learning to be independent. As kids get older, however, some may worry that something bad is going to happen to people in their absence, or they still feel lost and scared. Going to daycare or school can be difficult for children who experience separation anxiety, and they often experience something like the \"Sunday Scaries\" that adults get before the start of the workweek.For so many kids, the coronavirus pandemic made separation anxiety worse, because they grew accustomed to being at home. Spending so long on their own also made them \"too comfortable with the option of learning online,\" says Rebecca Rialon Berry, Ph.D., a psychologist with the Child Study Center at NYU Langone\\'s Hassenfeld Children\\'s Hospital, in New York City. \"When anxious youngsters know that an option for an \\'out\\' exists, they\\'ll often seek it out and persist until they get their way.\"  Adding to the issue, kids may live with separation anxiety disorder, which is a more serious issue than just being afraid of a new place. Unlike the nervousness experienced by a toddler starting school, separation anxiety disorder finds older kids exhibiting real dread at the prospect of leaving their safe, familiar haven. It may be particularly heightened when they are returning to school after a lengthy break. Cognitive behavioral therapy (and in rarer cases, medication) may help.Here are some separation anxiety symptoms in kids:  Feelings of worry when away from family or caregivers  Refusal to attend school or daycare  Throwing tantrums at the prospect of separation  Physical complaints like headaches, stomachaches, nausea, muscle tension, or difficulty sleeping  Constant need for reassurance (\"Do I have to go? Can you stay with me?\")  Unwillingness to sleep by themselves ', ' While some children find it difficult to leave their parent\\'s side, others struggle to make friends. Social anxiety can make kids deeply afraid and stressed out when they know they have to interact with other people. The National Institute of Mental Health describes the condition as \"an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others,\" and it turns going to school or a public event into a terrifying prospect. It usually affects kids between the age of 8 and 15, when they are just starting to step out on their own.  Once again, there was an uptick in social anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many children had limited social interaction. Global rates of anxiety and depression spiked by 25 percent in the first year of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and that certainly included cases of those with social anxiety. In the years to come, experts anticipate that the number of kids with social anxiety will continue to rise. Some say the mental health effects of the pandemic will be seen for a generation.  Be on the lookout for the following signs of social anxiety in kids:  Avoiding social situations, like sporting events, parties, and other extracurricular activities  Having difficulty interacting in a group—and having a limited number of friends  Withdrawing when placed in a group setting  Experiencing extreme worry and nervousness about being called on in class  If a child has social anxiety, they\\'ll likely have negative reactions to social situations. \"When avoidance of these situations is impossible, these kids may experience panic attacks or otherwise endure the experience with overwhelming distress,\" says clinical psychologist R. Meredith Elkins, Ph.D., the co-program director of the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"Rates of social anxiety disorder increase across childhood and peak in adolescence, which makes sense given the growing importance of peer relationships to kids as they enter middle and high school.\" ', ' It can be tempting to give an anxious kid a hug and tell them it will all be OK. But the most important thing for parents to do is acknowledge the anxiety their children are feeling, not try to somehow \"fix\" it.  \"Start by validating your child\\'s experience, letting them know that their emotions are understandable and that you accept their experience,\" Dr. Elkins emphasizes. \"Once you validate, express confidence in your child\\'s ability to tolerate their distress and do hard things.\"  You might say something like, \"You have done lots of new things before, and remember how they could feel hard at the beginning? But the more you did them, the easier they became. I know that you can be brave this time too!\" This pep talk might give them confidence without overwhelming them. ', ' \"Learning that we can tolerate our distress and do the things that scare us is crucial to developing resilience and confidence.\"  \"Avoidance fuels anxiety,\" Dr. Elkins says. \"Learning that we can tolerate our distress and do the things that scare us is crucial to developing resilience, confidence, and ultimately, to decreasing anxiety.\"Children with anxiety must be allowed room to breathe and process what they are going through. It\\'s especially important that little ones feel heard and understood, says Kerry Horrell, Ph.D., a psychologist who specializes in mental health care for children and adolescents at The Menninger Clinic in Houston.\"Rather than immediately attempting to negate their worry [by saying \\'you will have fun\\' or \\'that won\\'t be scary,\\' for example], help them name and put words to their fears,\" suggests Dr. Horrell. \"For really young ones, drawing and coloring can be a helpful way to express themselves. Expressing their concerns, even when they\\'re excessive or out of proportion, will help them to understand that they are experiencing anxiety, which can help it feel less out of control.\"  Remember: There\\'s no shame in getting your child some help, particularly if anxiety is affecting their lives. Seeing a mental health professional who is trained to treat children may be exactly what your kid needs.

', ' Use this age-by-age guide to find out the amount of food your child should be eating—and how to create healthy habits for a lifetime.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  When it comes to our children, we want the best—i.e. we want them to have stable relationships and build healthy friendships. We want them to be cared for (mentally, socially, and emotionally), and we want them to be happy. Every parent wants their child to \"be well.\" And a major part of being well is living well. We want to ensure our kids are physically fit. So how to you know if your child is nutritionally cared for? How can you ensure your kid is getting enough to eat?  To cut through the confusion, nutrition experts helped compile this guide of just how much food children need at each age, plus tips on how to stay on track. Follow their advice—and your child\\'s weight will be one concern you can cross off your list. ', ' Remember that baby of yours who happily ate chicken, squash, and most anything else that landed on their high chair tray? Well, they\\'ve likely been replaced by someone who is a lot less agreeable at mealtime. After baby\\'s first year, growth slows down—and so to does their appetite. Infants need to eat about 35 to 50 calories per pound, while toddlers require roughly 35 to 40 calories per pound, according to guidelines from the Institute of Medicine. How do you know if you\\'re hitting that target?  Trust toddler instincts. It\\'s natural for a 2-year-old\\'s appetite to be erratic from day to day. Yet according to a study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, up to 85 percent of parents say they push their kids to eat more, giving them rewards and praise for having a couple more bites. Believe your child when they push their plate away. Otherwise, they\\'ll start to eat when they\\'re not hungry—and that\\'s a slippery slope. \"Keeping you child aware of their hunger may go a long way to help prevent obesity,\" says Tanja Kral, Ph.D. Kids are just too busy to eat; after a few bites, they\\'re hopping down from the table to play. It\\'s okay to have healthy munchies (such as bite-size veggies, fruit, cheese, and whole-grain crackers) within arm\\'s reach during playtime, but serve most meals and snacks at the table so eating there becomes a habit, adds Dina Rose, Ph.D., a sociologist in Hoboken, New Jersey, who specializes in children\\'s eating habits.  Stick to a schedule. Serve meals and snacks about three hours apart. \"This helps keep your child at a healthy weight by \\'normalizing\\' hunger,\" says Jill Castle, R.D., author of Fearless Feeding: How to Raise Healthy Eaters From High Chair to High School. A child who\\'s always nibbling will never feel hungry. Plus, if your child skimps at one meal, you\\'ll both know there\\'s another opportunity to eat in a few hours.  Avoid food bribes. Yes, you\\'ll get the short-term gain of a few bites of peas or chicken, but telling your child to eat more than they want can set them up for a pattern of overeating. You\\'re also sending the wrong message about food. \"If kids think that vegetables are just the yucky stuff you have to eat to get to the good stuff, they\\'ll never learn to really like them,\" says Rose. ', ' Toddlers should have a maximum of two cups of whole milk a day; switch to water if your child is still thirsty. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that low fat or reduced-fat milk not be started before 2 years of age unless suggested by a doctor. Have water or 100 percent juice at snack time. Don\\'t exceed 4 ounces of juice daily.  Breakfast  Oatmeal (1/2 cup mixed with 1 tsp. brown sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon)  1/2 banana sliced  Lunch  Bean-and-cheese quesadilla (1 6\" whole-wheat tortilla with 1 tbsp. fat-free refried beans and sprinkled with 2 tbsp. shredded cheese)  1/4 cup chunky salsa for dipping  Dinner  1 oz. grilled chicken  1/2 cup roasted sweet potatoes  1/2 cup steamed broccoli (toss with 1/4 tsp. olive oil and 2 tsp. Parmesan cheese)  Snacks  1/2 cup low-fat flavored yogurt with 1 whole-grain waffle cut into strips  1/2 apple, sliced, with a piece of string cheese  1/2 banana  1/2 cup applesauce ', ' While you were able to keep tabs on what your toddler ate, kids this age might consume about 40 percent or more of their calories away from you, usually having snacks and lunch at school or on after-school playdates. \"Keep snack portions on the small side and boost the amount of food by about one third at the main meals,\" suggests Sarah Krieger, R.D. Other tips:  Make a lunch date. Some schools allow parents to drop by and have lunch with their child once in while, or at least volunteer in the lunchroom. \"Most kids this age are slow eaters, and end up throwing out a lot of their lunch,\" says Liz Weiss, R.D., coauthor of No Whine With Dinner. \"So don\\'t count on your child getting all the calories in her lunch box. Adjust their lunch size accordingly, and plan for a bigger breakfast or dinner.\"  Watch out for emotional eating. If your child is constantly asking for snacks, they may be eating out of boredom or even anxiety. Use a \"hunger scale\" with your kids: 0 is totally empty, 10 is totally full, and 5 is neither hungry nor full. \"If he\\'s above a 5 and asking for food, he\\'s probably eating for emotional reasons,\" says Susan M. Kosharek, R.D., author of If Your Child Is Overweight: A Guide for Parents. Children this age are old enough to understand emotions, so help give words to their feelings by asking, \"Are you angry? Are you worried?\" Then help them problem-solve or distract them from the situation without using food.  Serve family style. Allow your child to serve themself—without any prompting or pressuring from you—and they\\'ll likely take a portion that\\'s just the right size. \"Some parents unknowingly over-feed by giving adult-size portions, and kids get used to eating those larger amounts,\" says Castle. ', \" Serve meals with 3/4 cup of milk. The AAP recommends fat-free or low-fat milk for kids over age 2. Switch to water if your child is still thirsty. Have water or 100 percent juice at snacktime. Don't exceed 6 ounces of juice daily.  Breakfast  1 small whole-wheat bagel spread with 1 tbsp. nut or seed butter  1/2 cup fruit salad  Lunch  1/2 turkey-and-cheese sandwich on whole-wheat bread  Yellow pepper strips with 2 tbsp. low-fat ranch dressing  1/2 cup sliced strawberries  Dinner  2 oz. fish (such as cod or tilapia)  1/2 cup cooked brown rice  4 asparagus spears roasted in olive oil  Snacks  1/4 cup hummus and 10 baby carrots  1 small box raisins  1 clementine  1/2 cup dried fruit \", ' Your child\\'s growth slows down more during this time—kids gain about four to seven pounds each year until puberty—but calorie needs rise because many kids are more active. \"Sports and after-school activities like dance and karate are increasingly intense at this age,\" says Weiss. \"So kids end up burning more calories.\" These pre-tweens often get to make a lot of their own food choices too, from deciding what to have in the cafeteria to how much to eat when at a friend\\'s house. Make sure they fuel up right.  Keep an eye on weight. There\\'s a surge in the percent of overweight and obese kids in the years leading up to puberty. \"It\\'s normal for kids this age to become heavier in preparation for an impending growth spurt but, if treats get out of control, your child can gain too much weight,\" says Castle. She suggests limiting treats to one a day, and teaching your child to opt for water instead of soft drinks and other beverages with added sugar.  Plan for sports. Give your child a healthy meal or snack containing carbohydrates (such as whole-grain cereal or bread) and protein (such as lean meat, yogurt, or milk) before games. They don\\'t need anything except water to drink during and after exercise. Offer sports drinks only if they\\'re playing hard on a hot day for more than an hour, with back-to-back soccer games, for example.  Serve (some) favorites but don\\'t be a short-order cook. Be sure there is always foods on the table that your child likes—such as fruit, whole-grain bread, or a favorite grain side dish—so they can still be nourished even if they don\\'t love the entrée. ', \" Serve meals with 3/4 cup of 2% milk. Switch to water if your child is still thirsty. Have water or 100 percent juice at snack time. Don't exceed 8 ounces (or 1 cup) of juice daily.  Breakfast  1 whole-wheat pita filled with 1 scrambled egg  Sliced orange  Lunch  Pasta salad (1 cup whole-wheat pasta mixed with 1/2 cup sliced cherry tomatoes and 1 oz. cheese cubed and drizzled with 1 tsp. olive oil)  1 apple  Dinner  2 pieces cheese pizza topped with grilled chicken  1/2 cup broccoli with 2 tbsp. low-fat dipping sauce  1 small piece of chocolate  Snacks  1/4 cup each almonds and dried chopped apricots or cherries  1 cup edamame sprinkled with salt  1 whole apple \", \" Although you shouldn't count your child's calories every day, it's smart to know about how many are needed.

Although you can simply leave it at the hospital, here are eight other things you can do with the nutrient-rich organ.  Share  Tweet  Pin  Email  Looking for things you can do with your placenta after birth? We've got you covered. Though not nearly as exciting as your newborn baby, your placenta is a pretty spectacular thing. The organ provides nourishment and oxygen to your growing child throughout pregnancy. The placenta is typically delivered within five to 30 minutes of childbirth (though it can take up to an hour)—and if you want to keep yours, you probably can.  Placentas were once routinely disposed of by U.S. hospitals, but nowadays more parents are keeping the placenta after birth—perhaps with good reason. If you do think you want the option to take your placenta home, be sure to talk to your doctor or midwife ahead of delivery time, as every hospital and birthing facility has different policies, and they may need to do some additional prep to release your placenta to you.  But if you decide to take that step and are looking for ideas for how to get creative with your placenta, here are eight things you can do with it. \", ' A practice known as placentophagy, some people choose to eat their placenta after birth. They usually either encapsulate it into pill form or add it to smoothies. And it\\'s becoming more popular, with celebrities like Hilary Duff, Kourtney Kardashian, and January Jones eating or taking placenta pills after birth.  While there isn\\'t scientific proof that consuming your placenta has any health benefits, some parents swear it does help. \"Many moms report feeling a boost of energy after consuming their placenta, while others feel it helps them keep an \\'even keel\\' through the postpartum hormonal ups and downs,\" says Jennifer Mayer, certified placenta encapsulation specialist and owner of Brooklyn Placenta Services. \"Others feel it helps with breast milk production.\"  Keep in mind, however, that there are risks involved with eating your placenta. Mainly, it could be contaminated or spread illness. A 2016 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also says a healthy baby developed B Streptococcus agalactiae bacteremia (group B strep) linked to his mother\\'s consumption of her placenta. ', \" Parents can also choose to donate their placenta after birth. The nutrient-dense tissue can help with reconstructive procedures, the healing of wounds and burns, ocular procedures, spinal surgeries, and other medical needs. Placenta donation must be done through an accredited tissue bank; you'll need to get specific authorization, although the process won't harm your child in any way. If donation is your plan, tell your healthcare provider in advance as they may need to get special authorization or fill out paperwork ahead of time. Note that parents can donate other birth tissue as well, including umbilical cord tissue, the amniotic membrane, and amniotic fluid. Find out more information at Donate Life America. \", \" If you simply can't stomach the idea of guzzling your placenta down with some frozen strawberries in a smoothie, many encapsulators also offer the option of a body salve. This purportedly may help with C-section scars, perineal tears, and cracked nipples. \", ' Whether you go with a delicate pendant, beaded bracelet, or tiny drop earrings, having your placenta made into jewelry will make for a beautiful and constant reminder of your pregnancy—and, of course, one heck of a conversation piece. ', \" Don't have the desire to swallow your placenta via pills, smoothies, or other consumable ways, but feel it's too sacred to dispose of at the hospital? One potential solution: Planting the placenta after birth. This symbolizes a baby's link to the earth in certain cultures, but some modern parents like the idea of planting their placenta alongside a tree in their yard that will grow with their baby. It's a sweet visual reminder of how you were both once physically connected to one another! \", \" For the less blood-averse parents out there, you can get your creative juices flowing—so to speak—by inking a onesie or toddler T-shirt with your placenta blood. (Note: Best done before your child is old enough to tell you they don't want to wear a placenta-stained shirt.) \", \" Crafty parents can also try making placenta prints to frame and hang in the home. Consider going with the popular Tree of Life design to honor the beginning of your baby's life. \", \" Forget the $5 frame from Target; display your baby's first photo in a picture frame made of your placenta. Sure, it's a little meta, but when you think about it, why wouldn't you have such a precious and meaningful photo placed inside an equally precious and meaningful frame?

Some mental health disorders that can be related to behavior challenges—such as ADHD or autism—have a genetic element, and it is possible that a child is genetically predisposed to these disorders.  It’s also critical to note, however, that many non-adopted children misbehave, too; thus, a child’s challenging behaviors may be wholly unrelated to adoption. ']"
